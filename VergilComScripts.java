				"\n" + 
				"[2] Fato, a mixture of modal and instrum. abl., as in 4. 696., 6. 449, 466, &c. Here it seems to go with ‘profugus,’ though it might go with ‘venit:’ comp. 10. 67. Perhaps the force may be “profugus quidem, sed fato profugus,” a glorious and heaven-sent fugitive. So Livy I. 1., comp. by Weidner, “Aenean ab simili clade domo profugum sed ad maiora rerum initia ducentibus fatis.” For the poetic accus. ‘Italiam—Lavina litora,’ without the preposition, see Madv. § 232, obs. 4. The MSS. are divided between ‘Lavinaque,’ ‘Laviniaque,’ and perhaps ‘Lavinia.’ The last, however, though adopted by Burm. and Heyne, and approved by Heins., seems to rest solely on the authority of Med., which has ‘Lavinia’ (corrected into ‘Lavina’), with a mark of erasure after the word. ‘Laviniaque’ is found in the Verona fragm., and is supported by quotations in Terentianus Maurus and Diomedes, and in single MSS. of Priscian, Censorinus, and Servius in artem Donati. ‘Lavinaque’ is found in Rom., Gud., and probably most other MSS., and is supported by quotations in Macrobius, Gellius, Marius Victorinus, Pompeius, the Schol. on Lucan, most MSS. of Priscian, and one of Censorinus. Servius mentions both readings, saying, “Lavina legendum est, non Lavinia.” ‘Lavinia’ is supported by 4. 236: but the synizesis, though not unexampled (comp. 5. 269., 6. 33, and see on G. 4. 243), is perhaps awkward, especially in the second line of the poem, and the imitation in Prop. 3. 26. 64, “Iactaque Lavinis moenia litoribus,” is in favour of the form ‘Lavina.’ Juv. 12. 71 has “novercali sedes praelata Lavino,” though there as in Prop. the quadrisyllabic form might be introduced and explained by synizesis. On the whole, I have preferred ‘Lavinaque,’ believing the form to be possible in itself (comp. “Campanus,” “Lucanus,” “Appulus,” &c.), and more probable in this instance; the modern editors however are generally for ‘Laviniaque.’ Lachmann on Lucr. 2.719 speaks doubtfully. The epithet which belonged to the place after the foundation of the city by Aeneas is given to it here, as in 4. 236, by a natural anticipation at the time of his landing.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[3] The imitation of the exordium of the Odyssey continues, ‘multum ille iactatus . . multa quoque passus,’ being modelled on πολλὰ πλάγχθη . . πολλὰ δὲ ὅγε . . πάθεν: ‘ille,’ as so often in Virg., standing for the Homeric ὅγε. ‘Multum,’ &c., used to be pointed as a separate sentence; it is however evidently constructed with ‘venit,’ so that ‘ille’ is virtually pleonastic. Comp. 5. 457., 6. 593., 9. 479. Here it appears rhetorically to be equal to ‘quidem.’ ‘Iactatus’ is naturally transferred from wanderings by sea to wanderings by land. In such passages as vv. 332, 668, we see the point of transition. So 5. 627, “cum freta, cum terras omnis . . ferimur.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[4] Vi superum expresses the general agency, like ‘fato profugus,’ though Juno was his only personal enemy. Gossrau's fancy that ‘vi superum’ = βίᾳ θεῶν, ‘in spite of heaven,’ has no authority. For ‘memorem iram’ comp. Livy 9. 29, “Traditur censorem etiam Appium memori Deum ira post aliquot annos luminibus captum.” So Aesch. Ag. 155, “μνάμων μῆνις”. ‘Ob iram,’ below, v. 251, ‘to sate the wrath.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[5] Passus, constructed like ‘iactatus.’ ‘Quoque’ and ‘et’ of course form a pleonasm, though the former appears to be connected with ‘multa,’ and the latter with ‘bello.’ ‘Dum conderet’ like “dum fugeret,” G. 4. 457, where see note. Here we might render ‘in the struggle to build his city.’ So Hom. Od. 1. 4. foll., πολλὰ πάθεν . . ἀρνύμενος κ.τ.λ. The clause belongs to ‘multa bello passus,’ rather than to ‘iactatus.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[6] “Victosque Penatis inferre,” 8. 11. ‘Unde’ may be taken either as “qua ex re,” or as “a quo,” as in v. 568., 6. 766, &c. The latter seems more probable. ‘Genus Latinum,’ ‘Albani patres,’ ‘altae moenia Romae,’ denote the three ascending stages of the empire which sprang from Aeneas, Lavinium, Alba, and Rome. Comp. 12. 823, foll., which is a good commentary on the present passage. ‘Albani patres’ probably means not ‘our Alban ancestors,’ but the senate, or rather the noble houses of Alba, of which the Julii were one.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[8-11] ‘Why was it, Muse, that Juno so persecuted so pious a hero?’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[8] Caussae is not unfrequently used where we should be content with the sing., e. g. v. 414., 2. 105., 3. 32., 6. 710, the last of which will illustrate the epexegetical clause ‘quo—inpulerit.’ ‘Memora’ is appropriate, as the Muses were connected with memory: comp. 7. 645, and see note on E. 7. 19.—There are various ways of taking ‘quo numine laeso.’ Some think there is a change of construction, and that “inpulsus fuerit,” or something like it, should have followed; so that Virgil should have imitated Homer, Il. 1. 8, τίς τ᾽ ἄρ σφωε θεῶν ἔριδι ξυνέηκε μάχεσθαι; But this, as Heyne remarks, though not unexampled, would be a singular piece of loose writing so early in the poem, and would moreover involve the inconsistency of first saying that it was Juno, ‘saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram,’ and then asking the Muse what god it was. Others make ‘numine’ nearly equivalent to ‘voluntate,’ citing 2. 123, “quae sint ea numina divom;” but even supposing that ‘numen’ in this sense might be taken distributively, which the passage above quoted does not prove, ‘laeso’ would scarcely be appropriate to ‘numine’ in this sense, while the words frequently occur in conjunction in the sense of outraged majesty. Comp. 2. 183, Hor. Epod. 15. 3, and Macleane's note. Heyne accepts Serv.'s proposal of separating ‘quo’ from ‘numine,’ and taking it in the sense of “qua re,” “qua caussa,” which would be extremely harsh. It remains then, with Wagn., to regard the expression as equivalent to “quam ob laesionem numinis sui;” referring it to the cases already noticed on E. 1. 53, where the pronoun or pronominal adjective stands for its corresponding adverb. Thus the negative answer to ‘quo numine laeso’ would be “nullum numen Iunonis laesit.” Or we may say that ‘numen laesum’ alone would stand for “laesio numinis” (see Madv. § 426), and that in such a construction the question could hardly be asked otherwise than by making the interrogative pronoun agree with the noun. No charge of impiety strictly could be brought against Aeneas, but there might be ‘dolores,’ such as are mentioned vv. 23—28, which impelled Juno to persecute even one renowned for piety.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[9] Volvere: see on G. 2. 295, “Multa virum volvens durando saecula vincit.” The misfortunes are regarded as a destined circle which Aeneas goes through. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[10] Insignem pietate (6. 403) characterizes the hero, as πολύτροπον does Ulysses in the commencement of the Odyssey. The contrast, however, between piety and sufferings is made in the case of Ulysses himself, Od. 1. 60 foll., 66 foll. ‘Pietas’ includes the performance of all duties to gods, parents, kinsmen, friends, and country. “Adire periculum” is not uncommon in Cicero; see Forc.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[11] It is difficult to say whether ‘animis caelestibus’ is a dat. with an ellipsis of the verb substantive or the ablative.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[12-33] ‘Juno was patroness of Carthage, which, she had heard, was destined one day to be crushed by a nation of Trojan descent. Hence she persecuted the Trojans, who were already her enemies, and kept them away from Italy.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[12] Urbs antiqua, said with reference to Virg.'s own age. For the parenthetical construction ‘Tyrii tenuere coloni,’ comp. v. 530 below, “Est locus, Hesperiam Graii cognomine dicunt.” ‘Tyrii coloni,’ ‘settlers from Tyre,’ as “Dardaniis colonis,” 7. 422, are settlers from Troy.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[13] Longe, as contrasted with the adjacent islands. The sense is clear (“Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,” Dryden), though it is not easy to determine the exact grammatical position of ‘longe.’ The choice seems to lie between connecting it with ‘contra’ and making it an adverbial adjunct of ‘ostia,’ i. q. ‘longe distantia.’ The latter is a Grecism (Wund. comp. “τοῦ Τελαμῶνος τηλόθεν οἴκου,” Soph. Aj. 204), but may perhaps be supported by the use of “super” 3. 489, note. It appears that some in the time of Serv. actually took ‘longe’ with ‘dives.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[14] Dives opum, 2. 22. ‘Opum’ includes all sources of power. ‘Asperrima’ is the epithet of war (9. 667., 11. 635., 12. 124) applied to the warlike nation. ‘Given to the stern pursuits of war.’ “Ad bella studium,” G. 3. 179.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[15] Germ. comp. Od. 8. 284, ἥ οἱ γαιάων πολὺ φιλτάτη ἐστὶν ἁπασέων. ‘Unam magis omnibus coluisse’ = “unam omnium maxime coluisse.” The Astarte of the Phoenicians is identified, in the loose way common among the ancients, with Juno. On the temple of Hera at Samos, see Hdt. 3. 60.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[16] Coluisse, as dweller in the temple. Comp. v. 447. “Pallas quas condidit arces Ipsa colat,” E. 2. 61. For Juno's arms, comp. 2. 614, note. Her chariot is from Il. 5. 720 foll. The Phoenician Astarte was represented seated on a lion.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[17] Regnum gentibus, ‘the capital of the nations,’ instead of Rome. The dative, as in 8. 65., 10. 203. For the pronoun taking the gender of the following substantive, see Madv. § 313.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[18] Si qua is similarly used 6. 882. “Fata sinebant,” 4. 652., 11. 701. Med. 2 m. p. has ‘sinunt.’ ‘Iam tum,’ in that early age, long before it became the actual rival of Rome. ‘Tendit’ determines the construction, the infinitive being the object of both verbs. ‘Tendere’ is often followed by an infinitive, the subject being the same as the nominative to the verb, as “aqua tendit rumpere plumbum,” Hor. 1 Ep. 10. 20, “si vivere cum Iove tendis,” Pers. 5. 139. ‘Foveo,’ on the other hand, takes an accusative, as “fovere consilium.” These two constructions are united, the sentence ‘hoc—esse’ standing in the relation of an ordinary infinitive to ‘tendit,’ and of an accusative to ‘fovet.’ Three MSS. give ‘favet,’ and ‘vovet’ has been conjectured. Some have thought ‘hoc regnum—fovetque’ spurious, on the strength of a notice of Serv., which really refers to v. 534 beiow.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[19] Sed enim, 2. 164, &c., ἀλλὰ γάρ, ‘however,’ or ‘nevertheless.’ The present infinitive, ‘duci,’ denotes the event as existing in the designs of fate. ‘Duci,’ as in 10. 145. Gossrau, following a suggestion of Serv., thinks the ‘progenies’ is Scipio, which is very improbable, and besides makes ‘hinc,’ v. 21, inexplicable; and the same objection applies to Ladewig's more plausible explanation of ‘progenies’ as the great Trojan families among the Romans.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[20] Quae verteret, ‘to overturn.’ See on 7. 99. ‘Vertere,’ as in 2. 652, &c. As might be expected, some MSS. have ‘everteret.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[21] Late regem, comp. εὐρυκρείων, and “late tyrannus,” Hor. 3. Od. 17. 9. ‘Populus’ is a personification, and therefore takes the epithet ‘rex.’ ‘Hinc,’ i.e. ‘Trojano a sanguine,’ rather than ‘ex hac progenie;’ but it is not very clear, as, though in the latter case the distinction between the ‘progenies’ and the ‘populus’ springing from it seems unmeaning, the former view creates a tautology. In v. 235, where the expression is somewhat parallel, “revocato a sanguine Teucri” seems epexegetical of “hinc.” Serv. mentions that Probus marked this and the next line as doubtful; but it seems to have been merely a critical opinion. ‘Superbus’ here seems to be equivalent to ‘praestans,’ as in Sil. 10. 573, “I, decus Ausoniae, quo fas est ire superbas Virtute et factis animas.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[22] Venire excidio, like “venire auxilio” and “subsidio,” ‘Libyae’ being probably the dative, as ‘Dardaniae’ seems to be 2. 325. But there is room for doubt in both instances. It is hard to fix the precise meaning of ‘volvere.’ The passage 3. 375, “sic fata deum rex Sortitur volvitque vices,” is equally obscure; and we are left to choose between the ideas of a cycle of events (which is recommended by “is vertitur ordo” in the passage in A. 3), an urn in which lots are shaken, the threads of a spindle (which is the view of Serv.), and a book. I have returned to the common orthography ‘excidium,’ as being apparently the only one known to the MSS. of Virg.: but the word must be derived from “exscindo,” as “discidium” from “discindo,” unless, deriving it from “excīdo,” we pronounce it as a trisyllable by synizesis. “Excidio” on the other hand seems clearly to come from “excido,” like “occidio” from “occido,” so that we must suppose a synizesis in Plaut. Curc. 4. 3. 2, “Sed eapse illa qua excidionem facere condidici oppidis.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[23] Veteris and ‘prima’ are applied to the Trojan war, as contrasted with this new antipathy of Juno to the Trojans, caused by her anxiety for Carthage, as the former had been caused by her love for Argos. ‘Prima,’ adverbially, as in G. 1. 12.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[25] The words from ‘necdum’ to ‘honores’ are parenthetical. These ‘causae irarum’ are distinguished from the ‘vetus bellum,’ in other words, from the ‘irae’ themselves, the bitterness displayed in or produced by the war. Virg. had already, v. 24, suggested one cause in her love for Argos; but though this supplies a parallel to her present feeling, it scarcely accounts for its existence; so he goes back to show that her old quarrel with Troy had other grounds. ‘Dolores’ is the pang, put for the affront. It is only in the sense of the affront that it can properly be joined with ‘exciderant animo,’ understood of being forgotten. So “dolens,” v. 9. Or if ‘dolores’ is taken in its ordinary sense, ‘exciderant animo’ will shift its meaning, ‘had passed from her soul.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[27] ‘The injury which consisted in her beauty being scorned,’ explaining the ‘iudicium Paridis.’ The legend does not appear in Hom. earlier than Il. 24. 29 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[28] Genus invisum, ‘the hated stock,’ referring to the birth of Dardanus, who was the son of Jupiter by Electra, daughter of Atlas. The carrying off of Ganymede, who belonged to a later generation of the royal house of Troy, was a further provocation. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[29] The construction is resumed after the parenthesis with some variation, ‘his accensa super’ referring to the subjectmatter of the parenthesis. ‘Super’ for “insuper,” 2. 71, &c. Weidner connects it with ‘aequore,’ which is very unlikely. ‘Iactatos arcebat’ is equivalent to “iactabat et arcebat,” or “iactando arcebat.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[30] Reliquias Danaum, who had been left by the Greeks. Comp. Cic. de Sen. 6. 19, “ut avi reliquias (i.e. “Karthaginem ab avo relictam”) persequare,” quoted by Forb. Comp. Aesch. Ag. 517, στρατὸν δέχεσθαι τὸν λελειμμένον δορός. For the orthography ‘Achilli,’ see note on G. 3. 91. Here Rom. has ‘Achillis.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[32] Acti fatis, inasmuch as their destiny forbids them to rest. Comp. “fato profugus,” v. 2. The opposition which Henry supposes between the impulse of the fates and the repulse of Juno, though true in fact, does not seem to be distinctly intended here. They are said to wander round the seas rather than over them, doubtless for variety's sake. In v. 667 below Aeneas is tossed on the sea “omnia circum litora.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[33] Tantae molis for ‘tanti moliminis,’ as in Livy 25. 11, “Plaustris transveham naves haud magna mole.” The metaphor may be continued in ‘condere.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[34-49] ‘The Trojans were just sailing from Sicily when Juno saw them, remembered the vengeance Pallas once took on the Greek fleet, and chafed to think that hitherto she had done so little.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[34] Virg. plunges “in medias res,” as the commentators remark. See Introduction to this Book. The departure from Sicily closes Aeneas's narrative, 3. 715. Forb. takes ‘e conspectu Siculae telluris’ to mean ‘out of sight from Sicily,’ or of those who were in Sicily, comparing 11. 903, “Vix e conspectu exierat;” but there the sense is determined by the context: and the common rendering, ‘out of sight of Sicily,’ is more natural, and equally good Latin. Comp. e. g. “urbis conspectu frui,” Cic. Sull. 9. Generally, though not universally, where the noun in the gen. is a thing, the gen. is that of the object; and, in the present case, we more naturally think of the Trojans looking towards Sicily, than of Sicily looking towards the Trojans.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[35] Heyne puts a comma after ‘dabant,’ which is the punctuation of Med., but MS. authority on such points is of little value. Wagn. omits the comma altogether, on the ground that ‘laeti’ belongs to both verbs; which of course it does, in sense; but in construction it must be taken with the one or the other, and it is obviously better taken with the former. Virg., in fact, is imitating Od. 5. 269, γηθόσυνος δ᾽ οὔρῳ πέτασ᾽ ἱστία δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, Ulysses's voyage there answering to Aeneas's here. ‘Ruebant,’ ‘were driving before them;’ see note on G. 1. 105. “Campos salis aere secabant,” 10. 214. “Spumat sale” (“sale” neut. nom.) occurs Enn. A. 14. 1.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[36] Sub pectore, ‘deep in her breast,’ with a derivative notion of secrecy. Comp. Aesch. Eum. 156, ἔτυψεν—ὑπὸ φρένας ὑπὸ λοβόν. On a comparison of Lucr. 1.34, “aeterno devictus volnere amoris,” it is perhaps better to take ‘aeternum’ closely with ‘volnus’ than, as the order might warrant, with ‘servans.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[37] Secum: “sine conscio,” says Serv., comparing v. 225 below and 2. 93. ‘Loqui secum,’ as opposed to ‘loqui cum aliquo,’ is to soliloquize, if the person is alone; to think or mutter, if the person is in company. It is the προτὶ ὃν μυθήσατο θυμὸν of Od. 5. 285, where Poseidon takes the part taken by Juno here. ‘Mene—desistere:’ for this use of the accus. and infin. to denote indignation or surprise, see Madv. § 399. In Greek the article is not unfrequently prefixed to the infin. in this construction. ‘Victam,’ ‘baffled.’ For one aspect of the word we may comp. 7. 310, “Vincor ab Aenea:” for another, Hor. 1 Ep. 13. 11, “Victor propositi.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[38] Avertere, G. 2. 172. As Henry remarks, it means not merely to turn way, but to turn back. Rom. originally and Gud. have ‘Italiam.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[39] Quippe generally gives a reason (comp. vv. 59, 661 below, G. 1. 268., 2. 49., 4. 394), sometimes with irony, and here with indignation.—The use of ‘ne,’ which implies a negative answer, expresses incredulity that Pallas should have done what Juno cannot. Hom., Od. 1. 326, makes the minstrel sing to the suitors of the νόστον Ἀχαιῶν Λυγρὸν ὃν ἐκ Τροίης ἐπετείλατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. But in Od. 3 and 4, where the return of the Greeks is described in detail, he says nothing of a general storm. Ajax, in Od. 4. 499, is shipwrecked, but saved on a rock, in spite of the enmity of Pallas, by Poseidon, who afterwards, provoked by his impious boast that he would escape in spite of the gods, cleaves the rock on which he is sitting, and drowns him. Aeschylus, like Virg., mentions a general storm, and implies (through the forebodings of Clytaemnestra) that it was the punishment of some impiety. The crime of Ajax is fixed by Lycophron and others to be insolence offered to Cassandra in the temple of Pallas. Virg. however merely mentions him among others in 2. 403, where Cassandra is dragged from sanctuary. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[40] Ipsos, ‘Argivos,’ the crews, as distinguished from the ships. Forb. comp. Il. 14. 47, πρὶν πυρὶ νῆας ἐνιπρῆσαι, κτεῖναι δὲ καὶ αὐτούς.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[41] So Tryphiodorus v. 650, ἀνθ᾽ ἑνὸς Ἀργείοισιν ἐχώσατο πᾶσιν Ἀθήνη. I have placed a comma at ‘noxam,’ to show that ‘unius’ is not to be taken with ‘Aiacis Oilei,’ but that the second clause is distinct from and epexegetic of the first. Comp. v. 251 below, “unius ob iram.” But it is hard to judge in cases like this, where it is a question of minute considerations. See on 3. 162. ‘Furias’ expresses the Homeric ἄτη, the infatuation which impels to crime. Μέγ᾽ ἀάσθη is twice used of the provocation which Ajax gives to Poseidon, Od. 4. 503, 509. ‘Oilei’ is not an adjective, but a patronymic genitive, like Ὀϊλῆος ταχὺς Αἴας. In Cic. de Orat. 2. 66, and Ov. M. 12. 622, ‘Oileos’ is probably the Greek genitive. Hyginus and Dictys Cretensis however are cited by Freund for an adjective, ‘Oilëus.’ For the orthography ‘Oilei,’ not ‘Oili’ (which is however the reading of Med., supported by some grammarians, and adopted by Ribbeck), see Wagn. on v. 30 above, who decides that where the nominative terminates only in ‘eus,’ the genitive must terminate, not in ‘i,’ but in ‘ei.’ Rom. and Gud. have ‘Oilei.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[42] So Aesch. Eum. 827, she says of herself, καὶ κλῇδας οἶδα δωμάτων μόνη θεῶν Ἐν ᾧ κεραυνός ἐστιν ἐσφραγισμένος. Juno, in Book 4, raises a thunder-storm, but does not herself (‘ipsa’) hurl the thunderbolt. “Pallas fulminatrix,” and the owl grasping a thunderbolt, are found on coins. ‘Iovis ignem’ is of course merely a periphrasis for the lightning. See the passage from Attius cited on v. 44. Comp. Eur. Tro. 80, ἐμοὶ δὲ δώσειν φησὶ πῦρ κεραύνιον, Βάλλειν Ἀχαιοὺς ναῦς τε πιμπράναι πυρί (spoken by Pallas).\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[43] Eurip. l.c. makes Zeus send the storm and Poseidon raise the sea, Pallas being merely charged with the lightning. Quinct. Smyrn. 14. 444 foll. follows Virg., making Zeus give all his artillery to Athena for the occasion, and delight in seeing the storm which she raises. He imitates Virg. in the speech which Athena addresses to Zeus, vv. 427 foll., and also in the visit Iris is represented as paying on Athena's account to Aeolia, for the special purpose of making the tempest worse about the headland of Caphareus, vv. 474 foll., though in the latter case his narrative is more summary.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[44] Comp. Lucr. 6.391 foll., “icti flammas ut fulguris halent Pectore perfixo”; and Attius, Clyt. fr. 5 (quoted by Serv. on this passage), “In pectore fulmen inchoatum flammam ostentabat Iovis.” For ‘pectore’ Probus read ‘tempore.’ \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[45] Comp. Lucr. l.c. “Turbine caelesti subito correptus et igni.” ‘Turbine’ is the wind or force of the thunderbolt, as in 6. 594. See also on 2. 649. Forb. is right in placing a semicolon only after ‘acuto,’ to show that ‘Ast ego,’ &c. is connected with the lines preceding. One or two MSS. have ‘inflixit,’ which Cornutus ap. Serv. preferred “ut vehementius.” ‘Infixit’ is a little awkward after ‘transfixo;’ and the construction “infigere aliquem alicui,” to impale a person upon a thing, is, as Henry has pointed out, unusual, if not unexampled. ‘Infixit’ however is supported by Sen. Ag. 571, “Haerent acutis rupibus fixae rates,” quoted by Gossrau. Henry's interpretation, making ‘scopulo’ abl., and supposing Ajax to be pierced by a fragment of rock hurled at him (‘turbine’ being paralleled with “ingentis turbine saxi,” 12. 531), agrees to a certain extent with Quinct. Smyrn. 14. 567 foll. (not with Sen. Ag. 552 foll., who follows Hom.); nothing however is there said about piercing Ajax, who is merely said to be overwhelmed by the rock as Enceladus was overwhelmed by Aetna; so that the parallel is hardly made out. W. Ribbeck cites Seneca's poem to Corduba, vv. 13, 14 (Wernsdorf's Poet. Lat. Min. vol. 5, p. 1367), “Ille tuus quondam magnus, tua gloria, civis Infigar scopulo,” which is in favour of the common interpretation, as the writer evidently means to speak of his banishment to a rocky island as an impalement.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[46] Apparently from Il. 18. 364 foll., where Here pleads her dignity as greatest of the goddesses and consort of Zeus, as a reason why she should work her will on the Trojans. ‘Incedo,’ poetically substituted for the simple copula “sum;” with an allusion, of course, to the majesty of Juno's gait. The word itself, as Henry remarks, does not necessarily imply majestic movement; but this notion is gained by attention being directed to the movement at all, in a context like this; at the same time, of course, that it is enforced by the qualifying words ‘divom regina,’ &c. Comp. Prop. 2. 2. 6, “incedit vel Iove digna soror.” It is probable that Prop. had seen Virg.: see on v. 2 above.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[47] κασιγνήτην ἄλοχόν τε, Il. 16. 432. ‘Una:’ Juno thinks it strange that she should take so long to subdue a single nation; Venus, on the other hand (v. 251 below), complains that she and her son are persecuted to gratify a single individual, Juno.\n" +

				"[48] The old reading, unsupported apparently by the better MSS., though one or two have ‘adoret,’ was ‘adorat—inponat.’ Heins. and Heyne recommended, and later editors have restored, ‘adorat—inponet’ from Med., Rom., and other MSS. Some MSS. however, including Gud. originally, have ‘inponit;’ and this would appear to be the true reading, both from the instances quoted by Wagn. in support of the indicative against the subjunctive ( Ov. 3 Am. 8. 1, 2, “Et quisquam ingenuas etiamnum suspicit artis Aut tenerum dotes carmen habere putat?” and Consolatio ad Liviam Incerti Auctoris, 7, 8), and from the nature of the case. ‘Et quisquam adoret’ would be, ‘can it be that any one will or is likely to do it?’ ‘et quisquam adorat,’ ‘can it be that any one is doing it?’ If then the subjunctive is less forcible than the indicative, it is precisely because the future is less forcible than the present. Those who read ‘inponet’ explain the change of tense by saying that ‘adorat praeterea’ = “adorabit.”—‘Et’ couples the presents ‘adorat’ and ‘inponit’ with ‘gero’—‘I am proving my imbecility, and yet I have worshippers!’ ‘Praeterea’ then will express, not so much sequence in time, as a logical relation, like ἔπειτα. We may still however comp. “praeterea vidit,” G. 4. 502. ‘Honorem’ G. 3. 486. ‘Inponere,’ of offerings, 4. 453., 6. 246, 253, G. 3. 490. The general thought seems to be from Poseidon's complaints in two distinct passages of Hom., Il. 7. 446 foll., Od. 13. 128 foll.\n" +

				"[50-64] ‘She goes to Aeolia, the home and prison of the winds, and applies to Aeolus their king.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[50] Talia secum volutans. These words refer to the thought rather than to the expression: but that they are not incompatible with an actual soliloquy, appears from 4. 533, compared with ib. 553, and 6. 185, 186, compared with ib. 190.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[51] Patriam gives a poetical hint of the personality of the storms; comp. v. 540 below, G. 1. 52, note; Ov. 3 Am. 6. 40, “Nilus Qui patriam tantae tam bene celat aquae.” The notion of generation is carried still farther in ‘feta.’ ‘The home of the storm-cloud, the teeming womb of raging southern blasts.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[52] Aeoliam appears from 8. 417 to be Lipara. The Aeolia of Hom. (Od. 10) has been supposed to unite the characteristics of Lipara and Strongyle, the latter of which appears to be assigned by Virg. (l. c) to Vulcan. Comp. also Val. F. 1. 579 foll. The Aeolus of Hom. is not a demigod, but the king of a sort of magic isle, entrusted by Zeus with the control of the winds, but passing his life in continually feasting with his queen and children.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[53] Hom.'s winds are not represented as struggling, or the object of anxious custody. When Aeolus wishes to waft Ulysses to his country, he lets the west wind blow, and ties up all the rest in a skin. Val. F., on the contrary, with questionable judgment, makes Aeolus let loose the winds whenever he finds them ungovernable. Gud. originally had ‘luctatos.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[54] Henry (on v. 86) considers the whole picture of the winds to have been suggested by the Ludi Circenses, referring particularly to the words ‘inperio premit,’ ‘frenat,’ ‘fremunt,’ ‘carcere,’ and ‘claustra,’ and citing the imitation by Val. F. 1. 611, “fundunt se carcere laeti Thraces equi Zephyrusque,” and the description of a chariot-race in Sidon. Apoll. 1. ad Consentium, opening with “Illi ad claustra fremunt.” Against this may be urged the collocation of two of the most important words, ‘carcere’ and ‘frenat;’ inasmuch as ‘carcere frenat’ must mean ‘curbs with a carcer,’ not ‘curbs in a carcer.’ ‘Vinclis’ also appears to fix the sense of ‘carcere’ as a prison-house, and not a barrier in a race-course. Again, ‘circum claustra fremunt’ is not the same thing as “ad claustra fremunt.” The more reasonable thing seems to be to say that Virg. uses imagery principally taken from the race-horse and the prison, but without intending any one connected or uniform series of metaphors. Lucr., in a passage from which this is partly imitated (6. 189—203), compares the winds pent in a thunder-cloud to wild beasts in a cage, “in caveisque ferarum more minantur, Nunc hinc nunc illinc fremitus per nubila mittunt Quaerentesque viam circum versantur” (vv. 198—200).\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[55] Here we are reminded of an earlier part of the passage just cited from Lucr., where the storm-clouds in which the winds are confined are compared to mountains (vv. 189, 190) and caverns (v. 195), “moles . . quas venti cum tempestate coorta Complerunt, magno indignantur murmure clausi Nubibus.” It is possible that the Lucretian image may have suggested to Virg. his deviation from the account in Hom. ‘Magno cum murmure:’ comp. such phrases as “cum magna calamitate et prope pernicie civitatis,” Cic. 2 Verr. 1. 24. See also Hand, Tursell. 2. p. 152, foll. ‘Montis’ with ‘murmure,’ as v. 245 shows, in spite of the passage in Lucr. ‘While the huge rock roars responsive.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[56] It is not easy to say what or where this ‘arx’ of Aeolus is intended to be. The common notion is that it is the top of the mountain in which the winds are confined. Henry once thought it was an eminence within the cave; now he takes it of a fortress or palace in the neighbourhood. This last certainly seems the most natural meaning of the word. The citadel is the natural dwelling of a despotic governor (comp. Juv. 10. 307); in Greek history, tyrants seize it when they assume supreme power; and so here, as Aeolia is under a strong government, it is supposed to be furnished with an ‘arx,’ though the government consists in keeping the key of the prison. So in the description of the shades, Stat. Theb. 8. 21, Pluto is described as “sedens media regni infelicis in arce,” words apparently imitated from Virg., and doubtless to be understood simply as bringing out the notion of sovereignty, without any particular reference to the appropriateness of the image. It is in this ‘arx’ that Juno has her interview with Aeolus, who goes from it (though this is not directly asserted) to the dungeon, and opens the door. ‘Sedet’ expresses actual sitting, not, as Henry thinks, merely dwelling; but it has no further appropriateness than as carrying out the image of ‘arce;’ and so ‘sceptra tenens,’ the Homeric σκηπτοῦχος.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[57] Σκῆπτρα in Greek appears to signify generally the symbols of supreme authority rather than the actual sceptre. Virg. however uses it simply for ‘sceptrum,’ 7. 252, and probably this is the meaning here, though there is no special appropriateness in the image; see previous note. ‘Animos,’ like “animosi,” G. 2. 441 (note), is half physical, half mental. ‘Mollit,’ &c., as Henry observes, expresses the general effect of Aeolus' sway.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[58] Ni faciat—ferant—verrant. The present tense here, as in 6. 292., 11. 912, is substituted for the imperfect to give greater vividness, and express the greater imminence of that which is prevented or averted. ‘Faciat,’ E. 2. 44, note. Med. has ‘faciant.’ “Terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum,” E. 4. 51, note.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[59] Lucr. 1.277 foll. “venti . . corpora caeca Quae mare, quae terras, quae denique nubila caeli Verrunt ac subito vexantia turbine raptant.” ‘Quippe,’ as Heyne remarks, in prose would precede ‘ni faciat.’ Compare the position of ‘scilicet’ in poetry. ‘Per auras’ is equivalent to “per inane.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[61] The distinction attempted by Wagn. between ‘hoc metuens’ here and ‘id metuens’ in v. 23, as if ‘hoc’ referred to an immediate, ‘id’ to a more distant object of apprehension, is groundless. Virg. in v. 23 would naturally use ‘id’ rather than ‘hoc,’ having just said ‘hinc populum,’ &c., and being about to say ‘his accensa super.’ Otherwise ‘hoc’ might have stood there as well as here, as in either place it would only mean ‘this which I have just mentioned.’ ‘Molem et montis’ = “molem montium.” ‘Insuper’ is rightly taken by Wund. as ‘above,’ not ‘besides.’ Comp. 3. 579, “ingentemque insuper Aetnam Inpositam.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[62] Regemque dedit, &c., imitated from Od. 10. 21 foll. ‘Foedus’ is here nearly equivalent to ‘lex;’ as in G. 1. 60, “Continuo has leges aeternaque foedera certis Inposuit natura locis” (note).\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[63] It is difficult to say whether the object of ‘premere’ is ‘ventos’ or ‘habenas.’ If the latter, which is supported by “pressis habenis,” 11. 600, ‘laxas dare’ must be taken together as equivalent to “laxare,” like “Haec ego vasta dabo,” 9. 323. Otherwise ‘dare habenas’ might stand alone, as in 11. 623, “datis referuntur habenis.” ‘Iussus,’ “a Jove.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[64] Ad is not “apud,” as Serv. thinks, but ‘ad quem,’ &c. is equivalent to “quem allocuta est.” ‘Ad quem’ is used elliptically 10. 742. “Vocibus usi,” Lucr. 5. 1046.\n" +

Macrobius (Sat. 6. 1) says that the words ‘Divom pater atque hominum rex’ are from Ennius. Varro, L. L. 5. 65, quotes “divomque hominumque pater rex” as from Ennius.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[69] Incute vim ventis, ‘throw fury into the winds.’ Serv. quotes Enn. A. inc. fr. 117, “dictis Romanis incutit iram.” Henry adopts another suggestion of Serv., making ‘ventis’ abl., like “dictis” in Enn. l. c., i.q. “incute vim Troianis per ventos.” ‘Submersas obrue puppis:’ comp. note on “iactatos arcebat,” v. 29 above.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[70] Diversas was the old reading, supported by inferior MSS. Heins. restored ‘diversos,’ which would naturally be changed by copyists as slightly the more difficult. The idea of ‘age diversos’ is kept up in ‘disiice,’ though ‘corpora’ belongs rather to the notion conveyed in ‘submersas.’ Med. originally had ‘aut’ for ‘et.’\n" +

				"[71] In Il. 14. 267, Here bribes Sleep by the offer of one of the Charites in marriage, they being represented in Hom. as her attendants, like the Nymphs here. ‘Praestanti corpore,’ G. 4. 538.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[72] Deiopea is the reading of all Ribbeck's MSS. The common and easier reading ‘Deiopeam,’ which Heyne retained, is supported by quotations by Donatus and Maximus Victorinus. ‘Deiopea’ is mentioned with the epithet ‘Asia’ in G. 4. 343, as one of the companions of Cyrene. ‘Forma pulcherrima,’ v. 496 below.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[73] Heyne, whom Hermann (El. Doc. Met. p. 63) approves, gets over the difficulty of the quantity in ‘connubio’ by making it a trisyllable. The analogy of “pronubus,” “innubus,” might be pleaded, as proving a variation of quantity; a view strongly supported by Luc. Müller, De Re Metrica, p. 258, Munro on Lucr. 3.776. ‘Propriam dicabo,’ ‘make her thine for ever.’ See E. 7. 31, note. Juno speaks not only as the mistress of the nymph, but as the goddess of marriage. It is in the same character that she offers to dispose of the hand of Dido, 4. 126, where this line is repeated. The line in Il. 14. 268 is δώσω ὀπυιέμεναι καὶ σὴν κεκλῆσθαι ἄκοιτιν. Virg. characteristically keeps the form, while expressing himself in a different fashion. Σὴν κεκλῆσθαι ἄκοιτιν may remind us of “coniunx quondam tua dicta,” 2. 678, and we may remember that “dico,” “dicare” has an affinity in usage, if not in form, with “dico,” “dicere” (comp. 6. 138 note). ‘Tibi’ is not expressed, being really given in the two following lines.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[74] Il. 14. 269, Od. 5. 210, ἧς αἰὲν ἐέλδεαι ἤματα πάντα. Virg. appears to have taken ἐέλδεαι as the future, which, as Heyne remarks, would be supported by Od. 6. 281, ἕξει δέ μιν ἤματα πάντα. “Pro talibus ausis,” 2. 535.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[75] The sense will be the same, whether ‘pulchra prole’ is taken with ‘faciat’ (“per pulchros liberos, quos tibi pariat, te faciat parentem,” as Forb. has it), or with ‘parentem,’ as a descriptive ablative. Weidner comp. Hor. 3 Od. 5. 5, “Milesne Crassi coniuge barbara Turpis maritus vixit?”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[76-80] ‘Aeolus says he cannot refuse the goddess to whom he owes his power.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[76] He throws the responsibility on her. ‘Thine is the task to see well what thou askest.’ So ‘fas est’ is exculpatory. ‘I am doing my duty in executing thy commands.’ The general sense is from Il. 14. 196, αὔδα ὅ τι φρονέεις: τελέσαι δέ με θυμὸς ἄνωγεν.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[77] So Juno, 4. 115, “Mecum erit iste labor.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[78] Lucr. 2.15, “Qualibus in tenebris vitae quantisque periclis Degitur hoc aevi quodcunque est.” In both cases the form is depreciating, and here it denotes the depreciation of modesty. ‘This poor realm of mine.’ ‘Tu sceptra Iovemque Concilias,’ ‘you make power and Jupiter's patronage mine.’ Jupiter is the dispenser of the powers of the universe. Aesch. Prom. 229. ‘Concilias—das—facis,’ in the present, to express the tenure on which he continues to hold his station. Aeolus is far more complaisant than Sleep in Hom., who at first demurs violently to the request as dangerous to himself, and when promised a bride, exacts an oath from Here that she will keep her promise. In Il. 14. 212, Aphrodite tells Here she cannot refuse one who is the partner of Zeus' bed.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[79] Virg. possibly, as Heyne suggests, had in his mind Here's first offer to Sleep, Il. 14. 238, of a banqueting throne and a footstool; though this need not have been at the feast of the gods. He may also have thought of the “lectisternium.” This proof of equality, however, is sufficiently common: comp. E. 4. 63, Hor. 3 Od. 3. 11, Aesch. Eum. 351.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[80] Virg. probably refers to some physical theory or legend connected with the character of Juno as queen of the air: this conception of her as making interest with an inferior god is however perfectly Homeric. There is an awkwardness about the present line, which apparently merely repeats v. 78, and this when the mention of the banquet has intervened.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[81-101] ‘He opens the cave, the winds rush out, and there is a dreadful tempest. Aeneas, seeing nothing but death before him, wishes he had died with honour at Troy, like so many of his friends.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[81] Henry rightly explains the meaning to be that Aeolus, going to the cave, pushed the mountain on the side with his spear turned towards it (‘conversa cuspide’), and so opened the “claustra,” which are to be conceived of as folding doors opening inwards. Comp. 7. 620, “Tum regina deum caelo delapsa morantis Inpulit ipsa manu portas,” and the imitation of Val. F. (1. 608), “Cum valido contortam turbine portam Inpulit Hippotades.” The words and rhythm of the line are imitated from Enn. A. inc. 77, “nam me gravis impetus Orci Percutit in latus,” quoted by Serv. ‘Excipit in latus’ occurs 12. 507, and Stat. Theb. 1. 119 has “dubiumque iugo fragor inpulit Oeten In latus.” The ‘cuspis’ is perhaps the same as the sceptre, v. 57; but we need not press these details.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[82] Velut agmine facto, as it were with one accord, the sense of combination lying in the ‘facto.’ Comp. G. 4. 167, and Juv. 3. 162, “agmine facto Debuerant olim tenues migrasse Quirites.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[83] Qua data porta, through the ‘claustra,’ so opened.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[84] For the instantaneous effect expressed by the transition to the perfect here and in v. 90, comp. G. 1. 330. ‘Heavily they are fallen on the sea.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[85] Od. 5. 295, Σὺν δ᾽ Εὖρός τε Νότος τ᾽ ἔπεσε, Ζεφυρός τε δυσαής, Καὶ Βορέης αἰθρηγενέτης, μέγα κῦμα κυλίνδων. Comp. also Enn. A. 17, fr. 5. Seneca (Nat. Quaest. 16) reproves Virg. for having made three out of the four winds blow at once. Trapp and Heyne try to defend him on the plea that shifting winds are common. But this obviously is not his meaning. All the winds leave the cave at once. Milton's classicism has led him to the same violation of nature, Par. Reg. Book 4: “nor slept the winds Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad From the four hinges of the world, and fell On the vexed wilderness” (quoted by Henry). The effect of the emission of all the winds from the skin in Hom. (Od. 10. 54), is that Ulysses is blown back to the island from which he came. ‘Ruunt’ seems here to be ‘upheave’ (see note on G. 1. 105); but it is possible that the ‘aequor’ may be conceived of as a kind of ceiling, which crashes down on a movement from below.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[87] As in Od. 10. 121 foll., the havoc made on the ships is not expressly mentioned, but more vividly indicated by the cries of distress on board. Serv. quotes a fragment from the Teucer of Pacuvius: “armamentum stridor, flictus navium, Strepitus, fremitus, clamor tonitruum, et rudentum sibilus” (as restored by Hermann: see Ribbeck, Fragm. p. 100).\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[88] Od. 5. 293, σὺν δὲ νεφέεσσι κάλυψε Γαῖαν ὁμοῦ καὶ πόντον: ὀρώρει δ᾽ οὐρανόθεν νύξ. Comp. 3. 198, “Involvere diem nimbi et nox humida caelum Abstulit.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[90] Intonuere poli, “axes, i. e. extremae partes caeli super quibus caelum vertitur, i. e. πολεῖται, unde vertices Latine, Graece πόλοι dicuntur: duo enim sunt, Notios et Boreos, a quibus totum caelum contonuisse significat,” Serv. ‘It thunders from pole to pole.’ Heyne and others think it would be more forcible to omit ‘et,’ with one or two MSS.; but this would spoil the sense, as of course the lightning really comes before the thunder, whereas, if the two were mentioned separately, it would seem as if the poet actually intended to reverse the natural order.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[91] “Ostentant omnia letum,” Catull. 62. (64.) 187.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[92] Frigore, ‘chilling fear,’ in 12. 951, where these words are repeated, the chill of death. In the same connexion Hom. (Od. 5. 297), καὶ τότ᾽ Ὀδυσσῆος λύτο γούνατα καὶ φίλον ἦτορ.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[93] Schirach renders ‘duplicis,’ ‘clasped.’ But see 7. 140, “Et duplicis caeloque Ereboque parentes.” So Lucr. 6.1146, “Et duplicis oculos suffusa luce rubentis.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[94] Referre cannot here have its usual sense of ‘reply;’ nor can it mean to recount, as in “quid referam.” Either then the word must be construed simply ‘says,’ or it must be explained as an elliptical expression for “refert pectore,” which we find 5. 409.—‘O terque quaterque beati,’ &c. The whole of this is closely imitated from part of the speech of Ulysses, Od. 5. 306—312. The horror of Ulysses is excited by the prospect of death without glory and without burial; that of Achilles when in danger of drowning (Il. 21. 272), by the prospect of death without glory. Comp. also for the sentiment Aesch. Cho. 345 foll., 363 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[95] Ante ora patrum probably means dying with the friends, for whom they are fighting, to cheer them on. What is here the consolation of the son, is elsewhere the aggravation of the father's sorrow, as in G. 4. 477, A. 10. 443. ‘Troiae sub moenibus altis,’ 10. 469.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[96] Oppetere is merely a synonym for ‘obire,’ as appears from Phaedr. 3. 16. 2, Sen. Troad. 3. 6. 9; not, as Forb. and Doederlein think, especially appropriated to death voluntarily or bravely encountered. Aeneas is nearly killed by Diomede, from whom he is rescued by Aphrodite, Il. 5. 297 foll. Diomede is characterized as the bravest of the Greeks by Helenus, Il. 6. 98, Achilles being specially not excepted.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[97] From a fragment of Ennius quoted by Serv. on 2. 62, “Morti occumbunt obviam,” it would seem as if “morti occumbere” was the full phrase; so that the preposition may thus be explained. “Morte occumbere” and “mortem occumbere” however also occur. ‘Mene’ with inf. v. 37, note.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[99] Saevus has no special meaning here, but is the Homeric Ἕκτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[100] Virg. appears to have forgotten that in Hom. (Il. 16. 667 foll.) the body of Sarpedon is carried away to Lycia. Wagn. and Forb. however understand ‘iacet’ in the sense of a historic present, and render it ‘was slain.’ Perhaps we may say that Aeneas, who in the line before speaks of the act of dying, is here thinking merely of the moment of death. The expression however is the same in Od. 3. 108 foll., which Heyne comp.: “ἔνθα δ᾽ ἔπειτα κατέκταθεν ὅσσοι ἄριστοι:ἔνθα μὲν Αἴας κεῖται ἀρήϊος, ἔνθα δ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς κ. τ. λ.,where the meaning seems to be ‘There we left Ajax, Achilles,’ &c. ‘Iacet telo’ = ‘stratus est telo.’ ‘Ubi tot Simois,’ &c.: imitated from Hom. (Il. 12. 22), who however speaks of the spoils and bodies of those who fell on the banks of Simois. “Quos Simois premat ille viros,” 11. 257. A few MSS. read ‘sub undas,’ a variety mentioned by Serv., and supported by the parallel passage 8. 539. Jahn and Forb. suppose the difference of case to be justified by the difference of tense between ‘volvit’ and ‘volves,’ which is the word there. But it is not clear that in the present passage we ought not to connect ‘sub undis’ with ‘correpta,’ “volvit quae corripuit sub undis;” in which case the genius of the language would bear either reading.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[102-123] ‘The storm grows worse: the ships are dashed on rocks, stranded on sandbanks, or spring leaks, and one is wholly lost.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[102] Virg. continues to imitate Hom. (Od. 5. 313 foll.). ‘Iactare’ expresses the ‘wild and whirling words’ of Shakspeare. See on E. 2. 5. ‘Iactanti’ is a variety of the ethical dative, and may be illustrated by such passages as Livy 1. 8, “Locum qui nunc saeptus descendentibus inter duos lucos est, asylum aperit.” Comp. the Greek idiom βουλομένῳ τινὶ εἶναι. ‘Aquilone,’ “ab Aquilone,” Serv. But it seems better to render ‘stridens Aquilone,’ ‘howling with the north wind.’ Comp. Od. 12. 407 (a passage which Virg. had before him throughout this scene), αἶψα γὰρ ἦλθεν Κεκληγὼς Ζέφυρος μεγάλῃ σὺν λαίλαπι θύων. The north wind, as Seneca remarked (see on v. 85), has not been hitherto mentioned; but it is evident that the variety is in the expression, not in the incident. So in v. 131, Eurus and Zephyrus are obviously meant to include all the winds.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[103] Velum adversa ferit, ‘strikes the sail full in front.’ Gud. and the first reading of Med. have ‘fluctum.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[104] Franguntur remi: the oars are broken in the portholes by the sudden stroke of the wave, which dashes them out of the hands of the rowers. Val. F., in his imitation (1. 618), has “excussi manibus remi.” Rowing and sailing at the same time is contrary to the Homeric practice, so far as it can be gathered; and in Virg. himself (3. 207) the crew lower the sail first, and then take to the oar. Med., Gud., and some other MSS. (not Rom.), have ‘proram avertit,’ which Jahn adopts. But ‘procella,’ as Wagn. remarked, can hardly be nom. to ‘dat latus,’ though it might be to ‘proram avertit;’ and it would be very harsh to understand ‘navis’ with both. We have “avertens” in an intrans. sense v. 402. Wagn. now says (Lect. Verg.) “proram restituo, sed paene invitus.” Haupt and Ribbeck retain ‘prora.’ The oars being broken, the ship is at the mercy of the waves, which turn her head round. Weidner comp. Val. F. l. c. “conversaque frontem Puppis in obliquum resonos latus accipit ictus.”\n" +

				"[105] Undis dat latus, like “telo dat pectus,” 10. 425. ‘Cumulo’ is an adverbial ablat. So 2. 498, “amnis Fertur in arva furens cumulo,” ‘in a mass.’ ‘Praeruptus aquae mons’ is taken from Apoll. R. 2. 580, “κῦμα—ἀποτμῆγι σκοπιῇ ἴσον”. A huge wave comes down upon the ship.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[106] Hi is seen from what follows (‘Tris Notus,’ &c.) to refer to different ships, not to men in different parts of the same. Here the elevation and depression are described as simultaneous; in 3. 564 foll. they are undergone successively by the whole fleet. ‘Pendent’ as in 10. 303.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[107] Henry rightly understands ‘furit arenis,’ ‘raves with the sand,’ not ‘on the sand;’ comp. “aestu miscentur arenae,” in the parallel passage 3. 557, note. As he remarks, Virg. may be thinking of, if not specially referring to, the Syrtes, which are described by Sall. Jug. 78, “Ubi mare magnum esse et saevire coepit ventis, limum arenamque et saxa ingentia fluctus trahunt . . . Syrtes ab tractu nominatae.” Weidner comp. 7. 530, G. 3. 241. Comp. also Soph. Ant. 590, “κυλίνδει βυσσόθεν κελαινὰν θῖνα καὶ δυσάνεμον”, and Apoll. R. 4. 1265 “῾σπεακινγ οφ τηε σψρτες, ανδ προβαβλψ ιμιτατεδ βψ ϝιργ.᾿ ἤλιθα δ᾽ ὕδωρ Ξαινόμενον πολιῇσιν ἐπιτροχάει ψαμάθοισιν”. ‘Surf and sand are raving together.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[108] Latentia, i. e. in a storm, for in a calm they are visible, ‘dorsum inmane mari summo.’ Comp. 5. 125. These ‘saxa’ are generally supposed to be the “Aegimori insulae” at the mouth of the bay of Carthage. Pliny 5. 7, “Contra Carthaginis sinum duae Aegimori arae, scopuli verius quam insulae, inter Siciliam maxime et Sardiniam.” Mr. Long, however, identifies the ‘saxa’ with the Skerki Rocks, which are on the Adventure Bank, a shallow plateau between Sicily and Tunis.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[109] Suspicion has been cast by Heyne on this verse as a prosaic interpolation, but it is acknowledged by Quinct. Inst. 8. 2; and without it, as Wagn. remarks, ‘dorsum inmane mari summo’ would contradict ‘latentia.’ The order is ‘saxa quae mediis in fluctibus (exstantia) Itali vocant aras.’ Med. and Gud. ‘mediisque,’ an obvious error.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[110] Dorsum, 10. 303. ‘Ab alto,’ from the deep sea, contrasted with ‘brevia.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[111] In brevia et Syrtis, i. e. “in brevia Syrtium.” We have “brevibus vadis,” 5. 220. So Tac. A. 1. 70, “Neque discerni poterant incerta ab solidis, brevia a profundis.” Serv. compares τὰ βραχέα.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[113] ‘Oronten:’ Med. and Gud. here, and in 6. 334 (in the latter passage Rom. also), have ‘Orontem.’ But the analogy of other words of the sort formed from the Greek, as written in the best MSS. of Virg., is in favour of ‘Oronten;’ which is supported too by Charisius (see on v. 220), and defended by Wagn. (Q. V. 3); who however does not appear altogether consistent in adopting ‘im’ as the accus. of names in ‘is,’ though the best MSS. support him. ‘Fidus’ is a natural epithet of an ally who had followed the fortunes of Troy, not only during the siege, but in exile.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[114] Ipsius, Aeneas. ‘Ingens pontus,’ ‘a vast mass of sea,’ as we speak of ‘shipping a heavy sea.’ No authority is quoted for this use of ‘pontus;’ and from the imitation by Val. F. (4. 666), “magno puppim procul aequore vestit,” it would appear to be a phrase invented by Virg. himself. Od. 5. 313, ἔλασεν μέγα κῦμα κατ᾽ ἄκρης Δεινὸν ἐπεσσύμενον. ‘A vertice’ is a translation of κατ᾽ ἄκρης.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[115] Ferit (navim) in puppim, like “montem inpulit in latus,” v. 81. ‘Magister,’ properly the pilot, who is here the same as the steersman, “gubernator.” Both names are given to Palinurus, 6. 337, 353 (where “excussa magistro” is parallel to ‘excutitur’). Comp. Od. 12. 413. Serv. says some in his time read ‘pronum.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[116] Ibidem, on the spot. ἡ δ᾽ ἐλελίχθη πᾶσα, Od. 12. 416. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[117] Vertex, not ‘vortex,’ is the constant orthography of Med. Rom. and Gud. here have ‘vortex.’ ‘Vorat aequore,’ ‘engulfs.’ So “vorago.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[118] Rari nantes, with reference to ‘vasto.’ Comp. Od. 12. 418, where the drowning crew are compared to sea-birds.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[119] Some difficulty has been raised about ‘arma’ floating, which is justified by a passage in Livy, 1. 37, “fluitantia arma ad urbem cognita in Tiberi.” But the picture here is momentary, and flashes before the eyes of Aeneas. ‘Tabulae,’ planks. Comp. πίνακάς τε νεῶν καὶ σώματα φωτῶν Κύμαθ᾽ ἁλὸς φορέουσι, Od. 12. 67. ‘Troia:’ this is the orthography of the best MSS. in Virg., though ‘Troicus’ is found in other authors. ‘Troia gaza,’ 2. 763. For ‘gaza’ see on 5. 40, where, as in 2. 763, Med. has the spelling ‘gazza.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[120] The names of Ilioneus and Abas are from Hom. (Il. 14. 489., 5. 148), but the persons are different, both being killed in Hom. Ribbeck reads ‘Achati’ from a passage in Charisius 107 P, where Pliny is cited as instancing ‘fortis Achati,’ “acris Oronti” to exemplify the usage which obtained before his time with respect to Latin equivalents of the Greek genitive in -ου from proper names in -ης. But Pliny may have quoted from memory, confusing ‘Achati’ with “Achilli:” and it is perhaps a little hazardous to desert all the MSS. Heins., who illustrates this form of the gen. largely, says that in 5. 301 an ancient MS. gives ‘Achati’ for “Acestae.” This may show that the transcriber remembered having seen ‘Achati’ somewhere: but it may also remind us that Virg. made “Acestae” the gen. of “Acestes.” “Acesti” however is read by one MS. in the passage from Book 5.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[121] Grandaevus is said not to be found in any author earlier than Virg.; “grandaevitas” however is quoted from Pacuvius, Hermi. fr. 1, and Attius, Alcum. fr. 6, Bacch. fr. 7.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[123] Imbrem: Serv. quotes Ennius (Ann. 490), “ratibusque fremebat Imber Neptuni.” Lucr. uses “imber” for the element of water, e. g. 1. 715. Med. originally and Gud. ‘remis.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[124-141] ‘Neptune rises from the deep, and dismisses the winds with threats.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[124] Ulysses in the Odyssey (5. 382) is saved by Leucothea and Pallas, from pity and interest in his fate; but Neptune appears to intervene only to assert his own authority and repress Aeolus. See however 5. 801. ‘Magno misceri murmure,’ 4. 160.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[126] Serv. takes ‘stagna’ as the still water at the bottom of the sea. Heyne considers it to be the Homeric λίμνη. There is no difficulty in fixing the general sense of ‘refusa’ as ‘disturbed.’ Stat. Theb. 1. 359, “Stagnoque refusa est Funditus et veteri spumavit Lerna veneno.” But the specific sense, and the connexion of that sense with other uses of the word in Virg. (see 6. 107., 7. 225, G. 2. 163), are more doubtful. It may mean no more than that the water is poured back or worked up from the bottom. ‘Alto prospiciens,’ ‘looking out over the sea.’ Comp. v. 154. To the other interpretation, ‘in care for the main,’ it may be objected that we should rather have expected ‘suis regnis,’ or some such expression, and that Virgil nowhere else uses ‘prospicio’ metaphorically.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[127] Repeated from G. 4. 352, with the substitution of ‘placidum’ for “flavum.” ‘Placidum caput,’ because he was about to still or make placid the waves (Heyne). Henry compares v. 255, supposing, perhaps without necessity, that the gods took particular countenances on particular occasions. At any rate, there is no inconsistency between ‘commotus’ and ‘placidum,’ a subject on which Heyne has written an Excursus.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[129] Caeli ruina: comp. G. 1. 324, “ruit arduus aether.” ‘The downfall of the sky.’ Rom. and Gud. ‘ruinam,’ the ‘m’ being erased.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[130] Nec latuere, “οὐδὲ λάθον,” Apoll. R. 4. 753.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[132] Generis fiducia vestri, confidence in your semi-divine origin.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[133] ‘Iam—,’ ‘is it come to this, that’ &c. ‘Caelum terramque miscere’ is a proverbial expression for universal confusion. “Quid tandem est cur caelum ac terras misceant?” Livy 4. 3. Another variety of the same image is found in the parallel A. 5. 790 (note), “maria omnia caelo Miscuit.” “Sine numine divom” 2. 777., 5. 56, where as here ‘numine’ may be taken nearly in its strict sense of “nutu” (comp. 2. 123 note). The expression is not confined to poetry: Cic. Phil. 13. 5 has “Mihi quidem numine deorum immortalium videtur hoc Fortuna voluisse.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[134] We may either take ‘moles’ metaphorically, as ‘confusion’ (‘tollere’ being “excitare”), or as “moles undarum,” which is more poetical. Sil. 14. 123, “molem maris.” See on 5. 790.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[135] Quos ego—! A similar aposiopesis in a threat is quoted by Serv. from Ter. Andr. 1. 1. 137, “Quem quidem ego, si sensero—! Sed quid opus est verbis?” Emm. remarks that they are commonly followed by ‘sed,’ as in the passage just given. Comp. Ov. Her. 12. 207, “Quos equidem actutum . . Sed quid praedicere poenam Attinet? ingentis parturit ira minas.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[136] It matters little whether we take ‘non’ with ‘simili’ or ‘luetis:’ but the former is best. ‘Post,’ ‘another time.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[137] Maturate, ‘accomplish betimes,’ a sense which here would be equivalent to “properate,” though in G. 1. 260 (note) the two are naturally distinguished.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[138] Saevum, ‘stern;’ the badge of stern authority. Tibull. 1. 1. 22, “Terreat ut saeva falce Priapus aves.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[139] Sorte datum, the division between the three brothers was by lot, Il. 15. 187 foll. ‘Tenet ille,’ ‘his province is.’ Hor. 3 Od. 4. 62, “qui Lyciae tenet Dumeta natalemque silvam Delius et Patareus Apollo.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[140] Vestras, referring to the whole company, though only one is named. So 9. 525, “Vos, O Calliope, precor, adspirate canenti.” ‘Euri domus,’ in a different sense, G. 1. 371. ‘Illa,’ &c. Hom. Il. 1. 179, Οἴκαδ᾽ ἰὼν σὺν νηῦσί τε σῇς καὶ σοῖς ἑτάροισι Μυρμιδόνεσσιν ἄνασσε.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[141] Clauso is emphatic and a predicate (ἐν κεκλεισμένῳ τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ), though it may also be abl. abs., as Henry prefers to regard it. The words are well rendered by Trapp, “But bid him bar the prison of his winds.” This and the previous clause may seem to favour some other interpretation of v. 56 than that adopted there; but without extending, as Henry does, ‘aula’ to the whole of Aeolia, we may suppose that Aeolus occasionally visits and rebukes his prisoners. “Regnet in aula,” G. 4. 90 (quote dby Henry). \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[142-156] ‘He allays the storm, and extricates the ships.’\n" +

				"[142] Dicto citius, before he had done his speech the waters were calm. So in Aesch. Suppl. 598 (of Zeus), πάρεστι δ᾽ ἔργον ὡς ἔπος Σπεῦσαί τι τῶν βούλιος φέρει φρήν. One of Ribbeck's cursives has ‘Haec ait.’\n" +

				"[143] The reversal of v. 88, “Eripiunt subito nubes caelumque diemque.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[144] Cymothoe, one of the Oceanides, Hes. Theog. 245. In Apoll. R. 4. 1602 foll. Triton pushes the Argo into the sea, as Thetis and the Nereids had guided it through the Symplegades, ib. vv. 930 foll. Comp. the agency of Cymodoce, 10. 246.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[145] Navis, i. e. the three ships mentioned v. 108. ‘Levat,’ raises them with his trident, so that they may float off the rock.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[146] Vastas aperit Syrtis, makes a way through the Syrtes, so that the three ships (v. 110) may get out. Henry objects that ‘vastas’ shows that the action is on the whole Syrtes, which he accordingly supposes Neptune to level. But in the very instance which he quotes (10. 13, “Alpes inmittet apertas”) the meaning is not that the Alps are levelled, but that a way is made through them. ‘Vastas’ and ‘aperit’ are explained by v. 112, “aggere cingit arenae.” The ships are surrounded by the sandbank on all sides.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[147] Rotis levibus perlabitur: comp. in Hom.'s description of the progress of Poseidon, Il. 13. 29, τοὶ δ᾽ ἐπέτοντο Ῥίμφα μάλ᾽, οὐδ᾽ ὑπένερθε διαίνετο χάλκεος ἄξων. So 5. 819, “Caeruleo per summa levis volat aequora curru.” Heyne observes that such a Neptune is often found on gems.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[148] This simile is remarkable as an illustration of Nature from man, the reverse of which is the general rule in Virg. as in Hom. The image was no doubt suggested by the riots in the Roman forum during the furious political contests of the later republic.—‘Ac veluti.’ This passage, which has been already referred to in the note on G. 3. 196, is an instance of a simile where the construction of the sentence is fully drawn out. ‘Ac’ couples the whole (vv. 148—156) with what has gone before. The apodosis to ‘veluti’ is ‘sic’ (v. 154); that to ‘cum’ would seem to be ‘tum’ (v. 150), as it is there that the point of the simile is introduced. ‘Cum saepe,’ as Lucr. 3.912., 4. 1203, quoted by Forb.; apparently a confusion between “saepe cum” and “cum, ut saepe fit:” see Munro on Lucr. 5.1231. ‘Magno in populo,’ ‘in a concourse of people,’ not ‘in a mighty people.’ It may be questioned whether the position of the words here and in 6. 707, “Ac velut in pratis,” 11. 908, “Ac velut in somnis,” does not show that ‘magno in populo’ is meant to indicate the scene of the whole, so that a comma should be put after ‘populo.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[149] Animis, ‘in their minds;’ like “obstipuere animis,” 9. 123, not, as Heyne renders it, ‘with passion.’ In 5. 462, which Weidner comp., “saevire animis Entellum haud passus acerbis,” the addition of an epithet of course makes a difference. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[150] Iamque, ‘and at last they have begun to throw,’ &c. Comp. 12. 656, “Iamque faces ad tecta volant.” ‘Faces,’ to fire buildings with, were regular arms of a Roman mob. Tac. A. 14. 45, “conglobata multitudine saxa et faces minitante.” Serv. mentions another reading ‘volunt,’ which seems to have been supported from 7. 340. ‘Furor arma ministrat’ is parenthetical. Comp. 7. 507, “quod cuique repertum Rimanti, telum ira facit.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[151] Pietate, general discharge of duty; ‘meritis,’ services to the state. For the construction ‘pietate gravem,’ see on G. 3. 506.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[152] Adstant. Here and in 2. 303 (where the same words recur), ‘ad’ expresses attention. Comp. the expression “adesse animo,” ‘to attend to a speaker.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[153] Animos, like ‘animis’ in v. 149. ‘Iste’ had at one time crept into the text (Heyne's, e.g.); but it was a mere typographical error.\n" +

				"[154] Cecidit fragor, like “ventosi ceciderunt murmuris aurae,” E. 9. 58.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[155] Aperto, cleared of clouds. ‘With clear sky all round him.’ ‘Genitor,’ 5. 817, note.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[156] Curru (his chariot and horses) is the dat. after ‘dat lora.’ The idea in ‘secundo’ is that of easy gliding; and the expression may be compared with “cursus secundus” and “secundo amne,” and, what comes still closer, “vela secunda” in Ov. A. A. 2.64, F. 3. 790 (quoted by Wagn.). See also 6. 146, “namque ipse volens facilisque sequetur Si te fata vocant.” ‘Volans:’ see on G. 2. 41. ‘Dat lora,’ v. 63, note. For ‘curru’ Rom. has ‘fluctu.’\n" +

				"[157-179] ‘The Trojans find a convenient harbour with a cave at the end, land, and prepare a meal.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[157] Aeneadae. Lucr. (1. 1) calls the Roman nation ‘Aeneadae.’ So “Thesidae,” G. 2. 383, of the Athenians. ‘Quae proxuma litora:’ comp. v. 72, “quae forma pulcherrima.” So E. 1. 53, “quae semper.” The relative supplies the want of an article. ‘Cursu’ = “rapide,” as in 2. 321, &c.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[158] Vertuntur ad oras: comp. v. 528. The more usual expression would be “advertuntur oris.” ‘Vertuntur’ seems to be middle in sense, though Weidner takes it “casu vertuntur.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[159] Serv. seems right in treating this as an imaginary description. All the parts of it except the island are taken from or suggested by the harbour of Phorcys, in Od. 13. 96 (comp. also Ulysses' description of the coast on which he is thrown, Od. 5. 411 foll., also Od. 10. 89 foll.). Some have traced the island to the harbour of New Carthage, or the bay of Naples; but, as Heyne says, it is common to many harbours. See his Excursus. ‘In secessu longo,’ ‘in a deep retiring bay.’ Henry says it cannot = “recessus;” but the dictionaries show (what he seems to question) that it may mean a place of retirement; and the notions of a place where men withdraw, and a place which withdraws itself, easily pass into each other. The words recur 3. 229.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[160] Obiectu laterum = “obiectis lateribus,” ‘by the shelter of its sides.’ Caesar has almost the same words (B. C. 3. 112), “Haec insula obiecta Alexandriae portum efficit.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[161] Inque sinus, &c. ‘Parts into the deep hollows of the shore.’ Comp. G. 4. 420 (note), “quo plurima vento Cogitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos;” in which passage there is no island or breakwater, though the place is said to be “statio tutissima nautis.” Heyne, who there interprets the words as I have done, here, not very consistently, explains them of the curves of the retiring wave: and so Wagn., Forb., Gossrau. Henry, who formerly took ‘reductos’ to signify “the effect of the island to keep back that part of the wave which is opposite to it, and thus forms a ‘sinus,’” now makes ‘sinus’ the water filling the bay, understanding ‘omnis unda’ of “the whole undulant or sea.” This may be so far true that Virg. may have been more easily induced to talk of the wave as parting into the hollows from the applicability of ‘sinus’ to the contents of the bay, as well as to the bay itself.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[162] It seems best to take ‘vastae rupes’ as the line of cliffs, and ‘scopuli’ as the peaks at its extremities. ‘Gemini’ implies likeness; comp. 3. 535, “gemino demittunt bracchia muro Turriti scopuli.” Silius (4. 2) seems to have taken ‘minantur in caelum’ as “minantur caelo,” threaten the sky, not threaten those below,—the difference between ‘towering’ and ‘beetling.’ Other passages in Virg. (2. 242, 628., 8. 668) would rather support ‘beetling:’ in this case the words would be equivalent to “surgunt minanter in caelum.” Such too would be the analogy of ‘mineo,’ which occurs in Lucr. 6.562: “Ad caelumque magis quanto sunt edita quaeque, Inclinata minent in eandem prodita partem,” where however Lachm. reads “meant,” Munro, “tument.” That the two words are radically the same, cannot be doubted, whether the moral or the physical was the primary sense of ‘minor.’ Wagn. comp. Od. 12. 73, οἱ δὲ δύω σκόπελοι, ὁ μὲν οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἱκάνει Ὀξείῃ κορυφῇ.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[163] Late: there is an expanse of sleeping water below.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[164] Tuta seems to include the two notions, protected from the wind, and safe for ships. The latter seems to come from the context: the former is established by Od. 13. 99, αἵ τ᾽ ἀνέμων σκεπόωσι δυσαήων μέγα κῦμα. Forb. comp. Ov. M. 4. 525, “Imminet aequoribus scopulus: pars ima cavatur Fluctibus et tectas defendit ab imbribus undas;” Henry, Claud. Bell. Gild. 523, “Efficitur portus medium mare, tutaque ventis Omnibus ingenti mansuescunt stagna recessu.” ‘Scaena’ was the wall which closed the stage behind (Dict. Ant. ‘theatrum’); here it is that which closes the view. ‘A background of waving woods.’ It is difficult to say whether Virg. had in his thoughts the primitive ‘scaena,’ which Ovid (A. A. 1. 106) describes as formed of boughs (σκηνή, ἀπὸ τῆς σκιᾶς, Serv.), or whether he is thinking merely of the form of an ordinary theatre.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[165] Horrenti, ‘shaggy.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[166] Fronte sub adversa, under the front of the cliffs facing the entrance of the harbour; i. e. at the head of the cove. Henry thinks there may be a reference to the “frontes scaenae” (G. 3. 24). ‘Saxis pendentibus,’ from Lucr. 6.195, “Speluncasque velut saxis pendentibu' structas,” who in turn has imitated an old poet (supposed to be Ennius) in Cic. Tusc. Disp. 1. 16. 37, “Per speluncas saxis structas asperis, pendcntibus.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[167] Dulcis of fresh water, G. 2. 243. ‘Vivo saxo,’ 3. 688, not hewn, but natural, and as it were growing. Comp. G. 2. 469, note. These details are extracted from the much more fanciful description in Hom. above referred to, Od. 13. 103 foll. Comp. also Od. 12. 318, from which Virg. took the seats.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[168] Nympharum domus may be either in vague apposition to the two preceding lines, or in strict apposition to ‘antrum,’ v. 168 being a sort of parenthesis, like that in v. 12, above. ‘Fessas:’ comp. Shaksp., Rom. and Jul. Act 5. Sc. 4, “Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick, weary bark.” The weary ship reposes without the strain which the strong cable and biting anchor imply.

				"\n" + 
				"[173] Tabes is properly the moisture of decomposition, as in Livy 21. 36, “Per nudam glaciem fluentemque tabem liquescentis nivis ingrediebantur.” Here ‘tabentis’ is simply dripping, perhaps with a notion of foulness. Od. 5. 455, θάλασσα δὲ κήκιε πολλὴ Ἂν στόμα τε ῥῖνάς τε. ‘Ponunt,’ ‘stretch.’\n" +

				"[176] Serv. explains ‘rapuit,’ “raptim fecit;” Heyne, “raptim excepit.” Wagn. thinks the word has reference to a practice of waving the tinder to fan the flame. The question seems to be whether the motion expressed in ‘rapuit’ belongs to the act of Achates, or to the flame: either view would be defensible. Serv. explains ‘fomites’ to mean “assulae,” ‘chips,’ quoting two obscure and indeed corrupt passages from the Commentaries of Clodius: and so Festus, p. 64. Pliny, apparently with reference to this passage, says (16. 11), “teritur lignum ligno ignemque concipit attritu excipiente materia aridi fomitis fungi vel foliorum facillimo conceptu.” The process would be clear if we might take the ‘arida nutrimenta’ to be the ‘folia,’ the tinder in which the spark is first caught and kept alive, and from which the chip or match (‘fomes’) is then lighted. Comp. the imitation in Val. Fl. 2. 449, “citum strictis alius de cautibus ignem Ostendit foliis et sulfure pascit amico;” where “sulfur” (perhaps the match) seems to perform the part of the ‘fomes’ here. Weidner inclines to identify ‘folia’ and ‘fomes,’ which is not impossible.\n" +

Comp. 12. 589 (of bees attacked in their homes), “trepidae rerum.” Both expressions are apparently copied by Sil. 2. 234, “trepidi rerum fessique salutis,” where it would seem more natural to read, “fessi rerum trepidique salutis.” Comp. also v. 462, “lacrimae rerum,” “fessis rebus,” 3. 145., 11. 335. ‘Receptas,’ saved from the sea.\n" +

				"[180] Ulysses climbs a rock to reconnoitre the territory of Circe, Od. 10. 148. The prep. in ‘conscendo’ implies energy or effort, ‘scales.’ For this force of “cum” in composition, see Key, Lat. Gr. 1323. Serv. rightly points out that the chief is painted as occupied with nobler cares; as in 6. 9, where he goes to consult the Sibyl while the rest are kindling their fire, and scouring the woods. The stags are an accidental piece of good fortune (‘tela gerebat Achates’), which serves as a comfort and an omen of further comfort to the fleet. ‘Omnem’ belongs more properly to ‘pelago’ than to ‘prospectum,’ which denotes rather the-faculty or opportunity than the view or prospect in our sense. ‘Prospectum petere’ is found in Catull. 62. (64.) 241. Comp. also Pacuv. Chrys. fr. 9 (Ribbeck), “incipio saxum temptans scandere Verticem, summusque in omnis partis prospectum aucupo.”\n" +

				"[188] Fidus quae tela gerebat Achates is condemned by Peerlkamp, and regarded by Ribbeck as a ‘stop-gap’ (“tibicen”） which Virg. would have removed in correcting the poem. Really however it marks the accidental character of the affair, which is important, as remarked on v. 180. ‘Quae tela’ follows ‘arcum sagittasque,’ as “quo litore” follows “locum” in 7. 477, comp. by Gossrau.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[189] We should probably connect ‘alta’ with ‘cornibus arboreis.’ For ‘arboreis’ comp. E. 7. 30, “ramosa cornua cervi.” The antlers, of course, denote the age and size of the stags. ‘Ferentis’ implies conscious dignity, as in v. 503, “talem se laeta ferebat.”\n" +

There may be an allusion to the rout of an army whose chiefs are killed. Connect ‘agens telis,’ as in 4. 71. ‘Agens’ occurs alone in a similar connexion G. 3. 412, where also “turbabis” may illustrate ‘turbam’ here. ‘Nemora inter frondea:’ comp. 4. 70.\n" +

				"[193] Jahn on 5. 347 is right in saying that the sense of ‘fundat—aequet’ in this passage must be subjective, as it cannot be indefinite; ‘Aeneas refuses to stop till—.’ The best MSS. (fragm. Vat., Med., Rom., Gud.) have ‘humo,’ and so Non. p. 312, who however quotes the line to illustrate ‘fundo:’ ‘humi’ is supported by most copies of Serv., and some of Virg., including one of Ribbeck's cursives corrected. But the universal practice is in favour of ‘humi’ for ‘on the ground,’ while ‘humo’ is ‘from’ or ‘in the ground.’ In the parallel instances 2. 380., 5. 78, 481., 6. 423., 9. 754., 10. 697., 11. 640, 665, the best MSS. seem to read ‘humi’ without variation, though Arusianus quotes 2. 380 with ‘humo.’ Wagn. thinks the elision was the cause of the error, as in 3. 670., 5. 502 (and v. 104 above), where wrong readings have similarly been introduced into first-class MSS.; it is possible too that a transcriber may have recollected G. 2. 460. Ovid however (M. 4. 261) has “sedit humo nuda,” though there one MS. gives “humi nudae.” ‘Numerum’ &c.: Ulysses kills nine goats for each ship with one additional for his own.\n" +

				"[194] Hinc, ‘then.’ ‘Portum’ is the landing-place where the crew was encamping. ‘Socios partitur in omnis:’ he gives each ship a stag, in which each man shares equally. Forb. remarks that Aeneas must first have summoned his comrades to help him to carry the seven stags; an instance of Virg.'s brevity in narration.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[195] The order seems to be ‘deinde dividit vina quae,’ &c., as there is no other way of making sense of ‘deinde.’ There are other passages in Virg. where ‘deinde’ may be regarded as out of place, 3. 609., 5. 14, 400., 7. 135, but none where the necessity is at once so harsh and so inevitable as here. ‘Onerarat cadis,’ ‘had stowed in casks,’ instead of the usual phrase “onerarat cados vinis.” Wagn. quotes 3. 465, “stipatque carinis Ingens argentum;” and 8. 180, “onerantque canistris Dona.” The gift of wine is from Od. 9. 197.\n" +

				"[196] Heros is in apposition to Acestes, not the nom. to ‘dividit.’ Comp. 8. 464., 12. 902, and vv. 412, 691 below. It denotes the noble courtesy of the donor. Pierius' Medicean read ‘hospes.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[198] Neque enim. Comp. v. 65, “Aeole, namque tibi,” note. There seems no occasion to follow the commentators (Gossrau is an exception) in joining ‘ante malorum’—τῶν πρὶν κακῶν. ‘Sumus ante’ (including the present time in the past) corresponds to the idiom πάλαι ἔσμεν. So in the Greek use of the superlative for the comparative the object compared is included in the objects of comparison. The speech is modelled on Od. 12. 208 foll. Macrob., Sat. 5. 11, thinks Virg. the “locupletior interpres” here. Serv. says Virg. has borrowed it from Naevius' Punic War, which, if it means anything more than that Naevius imitated Hom., may apply to the latter part, where Virg. has deviated from his Greek original. See p. 23 above.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[199] O passi graviora: probably from Hor. 1 Od. 7. 30, “O fortes peioraque passi Mecum saepe viri, nunc vino pellite curas,” the ultimate source being Od. 20. 17, τέτλαθι δή, κραδίη: καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτ᾽ ἔτλης.\n" +

Lucr. 5.892, “rabidis canibus succinctas semimarinis Corporibus Scyllas”. ‘Penitus sonantis’ (‘resounding through their caverns’) also has reference to the dogs. Comp. 3. 432, “Scyllam et caeruleis canibus resonantia saxa.”\n" +

So they did not actually pass Scylla, but they came near enough to be in danger. In Od. 12. 209 Ulysses consoles his crew by reminding them of their escape from the Cyclops, but carefully avoids mentioning Scylla, which they were just approaching. The orthography ‘Cyclopia’ (Κυκλώπιος) is not found in any MS., but was restored by Heins., who remarked that ‘Cyclopea’ (Κυκλώπειος) would have the penult long. ‘Saxa,’ for a cave, v. 139 above.\n" +

(fr. 131), ὡς ἡδύ τοι σωθέντα μεμνῆσθαι πόνων, which is translated by Cic. Fin. 2. 32. Contrast, 11. 280, “nec veterum memini laetorve malorum.” Two assertions are included in Virg.'s words: ‘we shall remember these things’ (i. e. we shall live to think of them as past, and recall them as we are now recalling previous perils, which is the meaning of Od. 12. 212), and ‘we shall remember them with pleasure.’\n" +

				"[205] Heyne inquires how Aeneas came to know the name of Latium, when elsewhere he exhibits so much ignorance about his destination, and answers that he must have been told it by Anchises in the shades,—meaning probably by Helenus in Epirus, as Aeneas does not visit the shades till afterwards. But the proportions of Aeneas' knowledge and ignorance at various times even Virg. himself would probably have found it difficult to adjust (compare e. g. his knowledge of Italy from Creusa 2. 781 with his ignorance afterwards, 3. 100 foll.), so that we need hardly invent an explanation where the poet most likely had none. “Sedes quietae” Lucr. 3. 18 of the abodes of the gods.\n" +

				"[209] Traces of a reading ‘voltus’ are found in fragm. Vat., Gud., and another of Ribbeck's cursives; but the corruption is easily accounted for: see on v. 174 above. The balance of the sentence requires that too much stress should not be laid on ‘premit,’ which will mean not ‘represses,’ but simply ‘holds concealed.’ In 4. 332 the word has more force. ‘Altum corde dolorem’ is much the same as “alto corde.” “Spem fronte serenat” 4. 477.\n" +

				"[213] There is a doubt about the purpose of the ‘aena.’ Boiled meat was unknown to the Homeric age; but Virg. may have introduced the habit of his own time; and such seems to be the interpretation of Val. Fl. in his imitation 8. 254, where the caldron is skimmed. But, as Henry observes, the other view, that water was heated for bathing before the meal, is strongly supported by a passage in Apoll. R. 3. 271 foll., which Virg. probably had in his mind. “τοὶ μὲν μέγαν ἀμφεπένοντο Ταῦρον ἅλις δμῶες: τοὶ δὲ ξύλα κάγκανα χαλκῷ Κόπτον: τοὶ δὲ λοετρὰ πυρὶ ζέον. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Δμῶες δ᾽ ὁππότε δή σφιν ἐπαρτέα θῆκαν ἐδωδήν, Αὐτοί τε λιαροῖσιν ἐφαιδρύναντο λοετροῖς κ.τ.λ.  ”\n" +

A. ‘mensa’).\n" +

				"[219] It is not necessary to limit the meaning of ‘extrema’ actually to the crisis of death, (which would seem to be the sense of the phrase ‘extrema pati’ in Tac. H. 4. 54, “famem, ferrum et extrema pati,”) as in that case “passos esse” would be required here. The expression rather implies death as a continuing state: ‘to be lost.’—‘Nec iam exaudire vocatos.’ Wund. distinguishes between the “conclamatio” which took place at the moment of death, and the “inclamatio” or “acclamatio” which took place after the burial, and of which we have instances 3. 68., 6. 231, 506; and he thinks that the first is referred to here, on the ground that the Manes were supposed to hear the “inclamatio.” Henry may be right in going farther, and supposing the words to mean that the “conclamatio,” which, as he observes, was originally a means of ascertaining whether a person was really dead, actually takes place.\n" +

				"[220] Wagn. retains the comma after ‘Aeneas;’ but there is no reason to separate ‘Aeneas’ and ‘gemit,’ though in 6, 176 “Praecipue pius Aeneas” refers to what had preceded. ‘Oronti,’ the quasiGreek gen., as “Oronten” v. 113 is the Greek acc. ‘Oronti’ is supported here by fragm.

Sat. 6. 5 to be borrowed from the Helena of Livius (Laevius?): “tu qui permensus ponti maria alta velivola.” It occurs as an epithet of ships in Lucr. 5.1442, and in two fragments of Ennius. The word here may be meant to recall the scene which has just taken place on the sea; but it need mean no more than the sea with all its sails, as the earth with all its peoples. Comp. Lucr. 1.2, “caeli subter labentia signa Quae mare navigerum quae terras frugiferentis Concelebras.” ‘Terris iacentis,’ the earth lying outstretched beneath his gaze, as “glebas iacentis” (G. 1. 65) is the soil lying outstretched to the sun.\n" +

				"[224] Dispiciens, the reading of two MSS., mentioned by Serv., is restored by Ribbeck, who refers to Lachm. on Lucr. 4.236. Lachm.'s position is that ‘despicere’ only takes the acc. in the sense of contempt, an opinion improbable in itself, as the metaphorical meaning must have come from the literal, and requiring the alteration of various passages. The change, as remarked on v. 211, is slight, and might be made even without MSS.; but the reason for it appears to fail completely. \n" +

Comp. also ib. 5. 754, ἀκροτάτῃ κορυφῇ πολυδειράδος Οὐλύμποιο.

Ribbeck observes in confirmation of this, that elsewhere in Virg. ‘deum’ always occurs in the middle, ‘deorum’ at the end of a verse: but this is more likely to have been the result of ordinary metrical convenience than of design, and other commentators seem right in claiming for the poet liberty to use a hypermeter or not as he pleases.—‘Res hominumque deumque,’ taken in a loose sense for the universe, is the object of ‘terres.’\n" +

In prose we should have had “claudatur,” as the logical reference of the clause ‘quibus clauditur’ is evidently to ‘tantum.’ It matters little whether we explain ‘funera’ of the deaths that had actually thinned the Trojan nation, or as a strong expression for “clades.”\n" +

				"[237] Wagn. (after Heyne) supposes an anacoluthon, as if “quam sententiam vertisti” should have followed; but this would be very harsh, resembling rather the licences of the Greek poets than those of Virg. The omission of the verb subst. with the second person is paralleled by 5. 687., 10. 827. Ribbeck, who has attacked the omission of the verb subst. in various passages where it is acknowledged to be right in Wagn.'s elaborate essay on the whole subject, Q. V. 15, here reads ‘pollicitu's,’ as in 5. 687 “exosu's,” in 10. 827 “laetatu's.” In defending these readings in his Prolegom. p. 154, he fails to show that contractions admissible in Terence or even in Catullus are equally suited to a poem like the Aeneid, while he admits that in 5. 192 “usi” stands for “usi estis.” Rau proposed ‘pollicitum,’ which would be awkward.—‘Quae te sententia vertit:’ ‘quae’ is for “cur,” or “quomodo” (like “quo numine laeso” for “quam ob laesionem numinis,” v. 8); as appears from v. 260, “neque me sententia vertit.” ‘Te sententia vertit’ is poetical for “tu sententiam vertisti,” the opinion being supposed to change the mind as external persuasion might.\n" +

				"[241] Das: Jupiter is addressed not merely as the interpreter of fate, but as identified with it, and answers accordingly “Inperium sine fine dedi,” v. 279. So “pollicitus,” v. 237. Comp. 3. 375. Otherwise ‘dare’ would bear the modified signification of announcing; see on 3. 85.\n" +

				"[242] The legend of Antenor is given by Livy, 1. 1, where it is said that he led a colony of Trojans and of Heneti from Paphlagonia to the head of the Adriatic, whence he expelled the Euganei; and that the place where he and his followers first landed was called Troja. His story was variously told, Pindar, Pyth. 5. 19, taking the Antenoridae to Cyrene: the Romans however cherished naturally the legend of a migration to Italy, and one Largus, a contemporary of Ovid, wrote a poem on it. See Heyne's Excursus on this passage. ‘Elapsus:’ others, such as Sophocles, made him escape by collusion with the conquerors. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[243] Tutus is contrasted with ‘tot casibus actos,’ as Forb. remarks. ‘Penetrare’ is not so much to penetrate into, as to make his way through or past; Illyricum, the Liburni, and the Tergestinus Sinus, in which is the ‘fons Timavi,’ being all left on Antenor's right as he sailed to Venetia. The expression seems to denote the difficulty of a coasting voyage, such as Antenor would make up the east of the Adriatic, whether arising from the dangerous nature of the coast itself, or from the barbarity of the inhabitants. ‘Illyricos sinus’ may be either the Adriatic, as washing the shore of Illyricum, or the indentations in the Illyrican coast. ‘Intima regna Liburnorum’ is not so much the interior of the Liburnian territory, which Antenor coming by sea would not penetrate, as the kingdom lying far inward in the Adriatic. ‘Superare’ is said to be a nautical word by Serv., who quotes from Lucilius “promontorium remis superamus Minervae.” Here and E. 8. 6, where it is also applied to the Timavus, it probably denotes difficulty. It is just possible, however, that Virg. may intend to represent Antenor as sailing up the stream of the Timavus, in which case we may comp. 8. 58, “Adversum remis superes subvectus ut amnem.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[244] Fontem Timavi is rightly explained by Henry of the fountain or source of the Timavus. Between this and the sea (a distance of about a mile) there are subterranean communications, through which the salt water forces its way, breaking out at the fountain through seven mouths or holes in the limestone rock, and overflowing the channel of the river. See the account quoted by Henry from Cluverius, Ital. Antiq. 1. 20, and more recent descriptions cited in the same note from Wittmann and Schlözer. It appears from Serv. that this view was received by many in his time; but the subsequent commentators, including Heyne, Wagn., and Forb., understand ‘mare’ and ‘pelago’ of the volume of the waters of the river, so that ‘fontem Timavi’ has to stand for the river itself.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[245] Per ora novem: the general account, as intimated above, appears to be that there were seven of these ‘ora,’ or sources. Cluverius however l. c. speaks of the whole of the country to the sea as “unum perpetuumque saxum innumeris passim altissimisque antris perforatum;” and it seems from Wittmann's account that the ‘ora’ are constantly overflowed, so that their number is not easy to ascertain. Polybius asserts that the water in all but one of these ‘ora’ is salt, which Strabo denies. The two are reconciled by Cluverius, who reports from actual observation that the sea occasionally bursts up through six of the sources, and renders the water undrinkable. ‘Vasto cum murmure montis’ refers to the sound of the water re-echoing through the limestone rock as it bursts up; ‘pelago sonanti,’ to its sound after bursting up. “Magno cum murmure montis” v. 55 note. ‘Proruptum,’ ‘bursting up:’ comp. 7. 459, “toto proruptus corpore sudor.” Gud. originally and fragm. Veron. corrected have ‘praeruptum,’ which is mentioned but disapproved by Serv. This description of the Timavus has been censured as out of place in the speech of Venus; it however expresses the portentous character of the region into which Antenor is allowed to penetrate with safety.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[247] Tamen, in spite of all these dangers.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[248] Genti nomen dedit, probably Veneti, which was identified with Heneti. Henry however argues from ‘Troia arma’ that Troja is meant: see on v. 242. ‘Arma fixit,’ hung up his arms and those of his comrades, in token that their sufferings by flood and field were over. Serv. comp. Hor. 1 Ep. 1. 4, “armis Herculis ad postem fixis.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[249] Nunc, &c.: Wagn., Forb., and Jahn understand these words of the death of Antenor; but in spite of the special pleading of the former that a peaceful death would naturally be mentioned as the climax of the wanderer's happiness, and that Antenor, even during the Trojan war, must have been near the grave, it is evident that the sense required is rather that of a tranquil settlement following on labours. The language undoubtedly is such as is more generally applied to death or sleep, but the occurrence of such expressions as “conponere pacem” (7. 339., 12. 822), or “foedus” (10. 15), “conponere bellum foedere” (12. 109), and “urbem tuta conponere terra” (3. 387), proves abundantly that the words ‘conpostus pace’ may well have been used of the repose of a peaceful life. Possibly too Virg. may have thought of Ennius' celebrated lines (A. 18. 7), “Sicut fortis equus, spatio qui saepe supremo Vicit Olympia, nunc senio confectu' quiescit,” where of course peaceful old age, not death, is meant. The antithesis between ‘fixit’ and ‘nunc quiescit’ merely implies that, after having founded his city, named his nation, and hung up his arms for ever, he entered on a prosperous reign.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[250] Nos: she rhetorically identifies herself with her son. ‘Arcem caeli’ (for which see note on v. 225) denotes here the fullest enjoyment of divine honours which had been promised to Aeneas after death. ‘Adnuis’ with acc. 12. 187. ‘Adnuis’ has a special propriety as applied to a promise of Jupiter. ὑπέσχετο καὶ κατένευσεν, Il. 2. 112.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[251] Infandum interjected, like “miserum” 6. 21, “nefas” 8. 688. ‘Unius ob iram’ recalls “saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram,” v. 4.\n" +

				"[252] Prodimur, forsaken by Jupiter, not, as Heyne takes it, betrayed to destruction by the wiles of Juno.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[253] Honos, ‘reward,’ as in 5. 249, 308. ‘Reponis,’ restore us in Italy to the empire we have lost at Troy, though Weidner's interpretation of the prefix, referring it to the performance of a promise, is not impossible. ‘Reponere’ is connected with ‘in sceptra,’ which virtually means ‘into the possession of the sceptre.’ ‘Is this to restore a king to his throne?’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[254-296] ‘Jupiter reassures her, telling her what the course of the destined Trojan empire is to be, beginning with Lavinium, passing into Alba, and ending in Rome, whose greatness is to be perfected in the golden age of Augustus.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[254] Olli: Heyne comp. Enn. A. 1. 31, “Olli respondet rex Albai longai.” Niebuhr, Lect. vol. ii. p. 155, ed. 1844, says that Virg. admitted a few archaic forms in compliance with the precepts of the Alexandrian grammarians about epic composition. ‘Subridens,’ ‘smiling gently.’ The line is nearly repeated 12. 829. ‘Hominum sator atque deorum,’ 11. 725.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[255] Serv. quotes Enn. (A. fr. inc. 3), “Iuppiter hic risit, tempestatesque serenae Riserunt omnes risu Iovis omnipotentis.” Heyne refers to Gud. Inscrip. p. 5, n. 3, for an inscription “Iovi Opt. Max. Serenatori;” and Henry says there is a representation (supposed to be unique) of Iuppiter Serenus, with the inscription “Iovi Sereno Sacr.,” on an ancient lamp in the Passerian Museum. ‘Tempestates’ means the weather rather than the storms, so that there is no occasion to suppose a zeugma, with Wagn.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[256] Oscula libavit: see note on G. 2. 523, and comp. 12. 434, and Sueton. Aug. 94, “osculum pueri delibatum digitis ad os suum detulisset.” The word however, even in its primary sense, seems to mean, not simply lips, but lips for kissing. Heyne remarks that ‘natae’ is used after ‘olli’ as Hom. uses Ἕκτορι after τῷ δ᾽. There is great delicacy in the use of the subst. here, which has the force of “pater natae.” See on E. 8. 1, 18.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[257] Metu, the old dative, for which Weidner refers to Gell. 4. 16. 5. ‘Parce:’ see on G. 2. 339. ‘Tuorum fata,’ like “fata Phrygum,” 7. 294. ‘Tibi’ is the ethical dative connected with the whole sentence, as we might say, ‘to your comfort.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[258] Urbem et promissa Lavini moenia is a hendiadys. Many in Serv.'s time omitted ‘et.’ Observe the change of quantity from “Lavina,” v. 2, which is like that in “Italia,” “Italus,” “Apulia,” “Appulus,” &c., a larger licence being allowed for metrical convenience in proper names than in other words. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[259] Heyne quotes Enn. A. 1. 47, “unus erit quem tu tolles ad caerula caeli Templa,” which he supposes to be said, not by Venus, but by Mars, because Ovid introduces the line (F. 2. 487) in a speech of Mars praying for the deification of Romulus. ‘Ad sidera:’ see on 3. 158. Here apotheosis of course is meant. Gud. has ‘sublimen,’ a word which Ribbeck introduces here and elsewhere on very slender authority.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[260] Neque me sententia vertit: see note on v. 237, and comp. 10. 608, “nec te sententia fallit.” ‘Magnanimus’ of Aeneas, 5. 17., 9. 204, the Homeric μεγάθυμος.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[261] Wagn. has rightly changed Heyne's punctuation, ‘Hic, tibi fabor enim,’ which is also approved by Serv. ‘Tibi’ implies ‘thou shalt see him victorious in Italy.’ ‘Quando’ has the force of ‘quandoquidem,’ as ὅτε that of ὅτι. The ‘re’ in ‘remordet’ may express either a single recurrence or frequent repetition; the latter sense seems more natural here. “Cura recursat,” below, v. 662. ‘Remordere’ is found Lucr. 3.827., 4. 1135.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[262] Volvens is probably a metaphor from a book unrolled. “Volvendi sunt libri cum aliorum tum inprimis Catonis,” Cic. Brut. 87. Jupiter says he will open yet farther the secrets that lie in the book of fate. The notion in “movebo” is that of “quieta movere.” “Fallax historias movet,” Hor. 3 Od. 7. 20, quoted by Gossrau. So “excitare,” to cite, as we say colloquially, to rake up. ‘Awaken the secrets of Fate's book from the distant pages where they slumber.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[263] Bellum ingens, G. 2. 279. ‘Populosque ferocis contundet,’ ‘will crush its bold nations.’ Comp. 4. 229., 5. 730, &c.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[264] Mores conveyed to a Roman many of the notions which political institutions and a social system convey to us. Comp. 8. 316, “Queis neque mos neque cultus erat;” and see on G. 4. 5. There is not a mere play on the double sense of the word ‘ponere,’ as the building of a city implies a settled civil government. ‘Mores ponere,’ like νομοθετεῖν in Greek. “Inponere morem,” 6. 852; “Posuere urbem,” 8. 53. There may be a notion too of giving (‘ponere’ = “dare,” as θεῖναι ῀ δοῦναι), as ‘viris’ seems to show.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[265] The legend was that the first settlement (represented in Virg. by the camp) endured for three years, Lavinium for thirty, after which the kingdom was transferred to Alba, which lasted for three hundred. For the form of expression comp. v. 755 below.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[266] The propriety of ‘hiberna,’ as denoting that he was still in the camp, has not been noticed. ‘Rutulis subactis’ may very well be the abl. absol.; but it is more probably the dative, an idiom common in Greek, and found also in Juv. 14. 10, “Cum septimus annus Transierit puero.” It is a variety of the ethical or personal dative. See on v. 102 above.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[267] Fragm. Vat. originally had ‘quo,’ from which Ribbeck extracts ‘quoi.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[268] Heyne without reason suspects this line. It is a natural attempt to strengthen a weak point of the legend, the absence of any connexion between Iulus and any character in the Trojan story. ‘Dum res stetit Ilia regno’ may either be rendered with Wagn., ‘dum res stetit Ilio regno’ (‘res stetit’ = “fortuna stetit”), or, which seems better, while the Trojan state (‘res Ilia,’ like ‘res Romana’) stood with power unbroken (‘stetit regno,’ ‘stood in respect of its power’). In the latter case we may compare 2. 88, “Dum stabat regno incolumis.” With the perfect after ‘dum,’ in the sense of duration, comp. 3. 15, “Dum Fortuna fuit.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[269] Volvendis mensibus: here and in “volvenda dies,” 9. 7, Virg. has followed the usage of Enn. A. inc. 69, “clamor ad caelum volvendus per aethera vagit,” and of Lucr. 5.1276, “Sic volvenda aetas conmutat tempora rerum.” Both in this passage and in 9. 7, however, the ordinary sense of the gerundive would have force, as in each case it is a god who may be speaking of destiny, so that we may doubt whether Virg. would have used the word in a connexion where he could not have availed himself of common as well as of archaic associations. Understood in the ordinary sense, ‘volvendis mensibus’ will be an instrumental or modal ablative. ‘Orbis:’ “annuus orbis” occurs in 5. 46. The epithet which is here wanting must be supplied from the context, especially from ‘mensibus.’ \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[270] ‘Inperio’ may be either dative, ‘for his reign,’ or modal abl. = ‘inperando.’ Heins. restored ‘ab sede’ for ‘a sede,’ from Med., Rom., &c.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[271] Muniet, ‘build and fortify.’ ‘Multa vi,’ ‘with great power and might,’ not, ‘with strong fortifications.’ Virg. doubtless followed Lucr. 1.728, “multa munita virum vi”, where however population seems meant. Wagn. retains ‘longam’ as more poetical than ‘Longam;’ he however writes ‘Longam’ in 6. 766. A similar inversion of the names of persons is found even in prose writers. See Macleane on Hor. 2 Od. 2. 3.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[272] Serv. mentions a reading ‘hinc,’ supported by a correction in one of Ribbeck's cursives. Wagn. and Forb. explain ‘iam’ as “de eo quod nondum est, sed suo tempore certe fiet,” referring to 4. 566., 6. 676., 8. 42., 11. 708, Tibull. 2. 5. 56, in all of which passages ‘iam’ means ‘at once,’ a sense inapplicable here. We must rather take it therefore as contrasting Alba and its long-lived dynasty with the preceding members of the series. ‘And here the kingdom shall endure three hundred years.’ ‘Iam’ then will mean, at this point of the series of events. As ‘regnabitur’ is impersonal, we should rather have expected “a gente Hectorea.” The epithet ‘Hectorea’ is of course not strictly applicable.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[273] It is difficult to say whether ‘regina’ or ‘sacerdos’ is to be taken as the adjective. With the combination Weidner comp. v. 382 below, “matre dea.” ‘Regina,’ ‘princess,’ 6. 28, note, as Antigone is termed τὴν βασιλίδα in Soph. Ant. 941. ‘Sacerdos,’ a Vestal.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[274] For the construction ‘Marte gravis,’ and the meaning represented by it, see note on G. 3. 506. “Gravida ex aliquo” is used by Ter. Hec. 3. 3. 32, and Ovid (Met. 3. 260) has “gravidam de semine Iovis.” ‘Partu dabit’ = “pariet.” Comp. “Furtivo partu sub luminis edidit oras,” 7. 660.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[275] Lupae tegmine laetus: comp. Hor. 3 Od. 4. 34, “laetum equino sanguine Concanum,” and the similar use of “gaudeo.” Prop. 5. 10. 20 describes Romulus with a helmet of wolf-skin; but Virg., as Henry remarks, doubtless meant the ‘tegmen’ to cover the whole person.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[276] Comp. note on G. 2. 345. The notion here is that of succession. ‘The nation shall then pass into the hands of Romulus.’ There is nothing to warrant the notion of Thiel and Forb. that ‘excipiet’ = “accipiet asylo.” ‘Mavortia’ may point at once to the birth of Romulus, the worship of Mars at Rome, and the martial character of the nation.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[278] ‘His,’ as opposed to their predecessors, whose date was limited. ‘Metas’ probably refers to the bounds of the empire (‘rerum’), ‘tempora’ to its duration. ‘Meta’ however may be transferred from space to time, 10. 472. With ‘his tempora pono’ we may compare “Stat sua cuique dies,” 10. 467. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[280] Metu is commonly taken with ‘fatigat’ (like “omnia magno Ne cesses turbare metu,” 11. 400), expressing the terror which Juno spreads through the universe. It may however, and perhaps better, be taken, as Serv. suggests, for the alarm which Juno feels at the course of destiny, if we compare v. 23, “id metuens,” and 10. 9. ‘Fatigat’ will then mean, keeps earth, air, and sea astir, by constantly traversing them and exciting their powers; so “remigio noctemque diemque fatigant,” 8. 92. Thus Virg. may have had in his eye Il. 4. 26, where Here complains of the toil which she and her horses have undergone in persecuting the Trojans: comp. also Il. 8. 478 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[281] The phrase ‘in melius referre’ is twice used in Virg. (here and 11. 425) for ‘to amend.’ Serv. refers to Ennius (A. 289) as saying that Juno became reconciled to the Romans in the second Punic war. There would naturally be different opinions about the time when her sentiments changed: Horace has his own, 3 Od. 3. 16 foll.: Virg. seems to put the date earlier, 12. 841, though elsewhere, as in 10. 11 foll., he intimates that the gods take part in the struggle between Rome and Carthage.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[282] Macrobius (Sat. 6. 5) says that Laberius was the author of this line; and Suetonius (Aug. 40) tells a story of Augustus' quoting it. It had probably become a stock line to express the grandeur of imperial Rome. ‘Gentem togatam’ is not a tame addition, being sufficiently characteristic; so that there is no need with Heyne to seek a point in any antithesis between “arma” and “toga.” Hor. 3 Od. 5. 10, “Anciliorum et nominis et togae Oblitus.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[283] Sic placitum, οὕτως δέδοκται. Jupiter is speaking destiny. It will be observed that ‘lustra’ being a strictly Roman measure of time, Jupiter is thus made to speak the language of the great nation. ‘As Rome's years roll on.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[284] Assaracus is the ancestor through whom Aeneas was related to the royal house of Troy. Comp. Il. 20. 230. ‘The descendants of Aeneas shall triumph over those of Achilles (‘Phthiam’), Agamemnon (‘Mycenas’), and Diomede (‘Argos’).’ Comp. 6. 838, “Eruet ille Argos Agamemnoniasque Mycenas, Ipsumque Aeaciden, genus armipotentis Achilli.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[286] Caesar, Augustus (Julius Caesar by adoption); not, as Serv. thinks, Julius, who could hardly be said to be laden with the spoils of the East, and who was not the primary object of a Roman's homage. We may observe that he is not distinctly spoken of here as Julius Caesar, which would have been ambiguous, but is called Caesar, the gentile name Julius being mentioned as connecting him with Iulus. It may seem against this that his apotheosis is spoken of v. 289; but we may be meant to understand the deification as taking place during his life, as we know it to have done, E. 1. 44 note, Hor. 2 Ep. . 15. With the whole passage comp. 6. 791 foll. ‘Pulchra Troianus origine,’ from the high line of Troy; as though it had been “pulchra Troianorum origine.” This connects the line with those which precede. It is conceivable however, as has been suggested to me, that ‘pulchra’ may refer to Augustus' personal beauty, an allusion to which would be appropriate in a speech to Venus.\n" +

				"[292] These four deities are chosen, as Henry remarks, as typical of the primitive and golden age of Rome. Vesta has been mentioned before in a similar connexion G. 1. 498, Romulus and Remus G. 2. 533. The union of the two latter, as Heyne observes, symbolizes the end of civil broils. Numa (Livy 1. 21) established the worship of Fides. Comp. Hor. Car. Saec. 57, “Iam Fides et Pax et Honor Pudorque priscus.” ‘Cana’ occurs 5. 744, as an epithet of Vesta.\n" +

				"[293] Iura dabunt, ‘shall impose laws,’ not, ‘shall administer justice’ (“ius dicent” or “reddent”) Henry. The function in Virg. is generally a royal one, v. 507., 3. 137., 5. 758 note: see however 8. 670. ‘Ferro et conpagibus artis’ (a hendiadys) should be taken, as Henry says, with ‘dirae.’ ‘The gates of war grim with closelywelded plates ofiron.’ It will answer then to “ferratos postis” 7. 622. ‘Conpagibus’ would not be a natural expression for bolts or bars, in spite of the parallel 7. 609. The word is twice used for planking, above v. 126 and 2. 51. The allusion is to the closing of the temple of Janus A. U. C. 725. Virg. prefers calling it the temple of War here and in 7. 607, where it is described at length; and this agrees with Plut. Numa 19, quoted on the latter passage. Comp. also the lines of Ennius (?) cited by Hor. 1 S. 4. 60, “postquam Discordia tetra Belli ferratos postis portasque refregit.”\n" +

The imagery in this passage is supposed to be derived from a painting of Apelles mentioned by Pliny 35. 10, representing War fettered, which was placed by Augustus in his own forum. Germanus Valens thinks that there is an allusion to a statue of Ares, mentioned by Pausanias, representing the god bound and seated on a pile of arms; the meaning of the binding being apparently that he was not to pass over to the enemy.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[295] Saeva arma 8. 482, &c. ‘Manus post terga revinctum’ 2. 57. Here ‘manus’ is inferred from ‘post tergum.’ ‘Nodi’ are coupled with ‘vincla’ Lucr. 6.356.\n" +

				"[297-304] ‘Mercury is sent down to dispose Dido and the Carthaginians to welcome the Trojans.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[297] Mercury's mission is rather indefinite, as Virg. can have hardly meant him actually to convene Dido and the Carthaginians as he convenes Aeneas in 4. 265 foll. There may be a confusion between the Homeric character of Hermes as the messenger of the gods and his other character as the god of eloquence and the civilizer of mankind; for which see Hor. 1 Od. 10 and Ov. F. 5. 663.—‘Demittit— pateant—arceret.’ Jahn rightly remarks that ‘ut pateant’ expresses Jupiter's charge to Mercury, ‘arceret’ his object in giving it. The former, it is obvious, would naturally come under the historic present, but it could hardly have been extended to the latter.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[298] Terrae—arces: that they might be allowed to enter the territory and be received into the city. Pal. originally had ‘terra.’ ‘Novae’ is to be taken with ‘Karthaginis,’ as is proved by v. 366, on which Serv. says “Karthago est lingua Poenorum Nova Civitas, ut docet Livius.” In the same way Virg. uses epithets explanatory of the etymology of the name 3. 693, “Plemyrium undosum;” 698, “stagnantis Helori;” 703, “arduus Acragas;” 705, “palmosa Selinus.” With ‘pateant’ Forb. comp. “clauditur orbis” above v. 233.\n" +

Heyne's explanation, that Dido's ignorance of destiny might lead her to suppose that the Trojans wished to settle at Carthage, seems less likely. Rom. originally had ‘fatis.’\n" +

				"[302] Ponuntque shows that the effect of Mercury's mission is almost simultaneous with the discharge of it. Comp. the use of “que” after “vix” 2. 692 &c., and that of “iamque” followed by a sentence without a connecting particle 2. 132 foll. “Iussa facessunt” 4. 295. “Pone animos” 11. 366. It may be doubted whether the meaning is ‘to lay aside’ or ‘to allay,’ as in Hor. 1 Od. 3. 16, “tollere seu ponere freta” (comp. “animos tollent sata” G. 2. 350); but such expressions as “ponere inimicitias” seem rather in favour of the former. So probably “iram ponit” Hor. A. P. 160, as the antithesis to “colligit” appears to show. Here possibly ‘accipit’ may point the same way, though ‘quietum’ might be pressed on the other side.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[303] Volente deo. Θεοῦ θέλοντος occurs Aesch. Theb. 427 and elsewhere in the sense of θεῶν θελόντων: so that it is possible that ‘volente deo’ is meant to be understood generally, not taken of Mercury, which is the common interpretation. The participle will of course bear the sense either of, ‘if he wills,’ or, as here, ‘since he wills.’ ‘Quietum,’ ‘peaceful,’ opp. to “turbatus” (8. 435) and “turbidus” (11. 742 &c.). ‘Animum—mentem:’ comp. “magnam mentem animumque” 6. 11, and the Homeric κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν. Lucr. couples “mens animusque” 1. 74 (where see Munro), 3. 142, 403: in 3. 94 he uses the words convertibly, “animum . . . mentem quam saepe vocamus,” and in 6. 1183 he talks of “animi mens.” ‘Accipere mentem’ is used differently below, v. 676.\n" +

				"[305] There is a slight inaccuracy in ‘volvens,’ as if the thoughts of the night continued into the day; the present participle being perhaps suggested by πολλὰ φρεσὶν ὁρμαίνοντα, Il. 10. 4. Wagn., who will not allow that ‘volvens’ can be equivalent to “qui volverat,” followed by Forb., supposes the sense to be that Aeneas resolved during the night to go out at daybreak; but this would only introduce worse confusion, as ‘ut primum lux alma data est’ cannot mean, ‘as soon as the day should dawn:’ not to mention the abruptness of the transition from, ‘constituit,’ thus explained, to ‘occulit.’\n" +

				"[307] Explorare has an object clause over and above the accusative in 7. 150, so that it may be constructed here with ‘quas—oras,’ ‘quaerere’ being added as a piece of surplusage for the sake of clearness, like “memoret” after “fari” 2. 75. ‘Vento,’ by stress of weather, as in 4. 46.

Weidner makes it mean “accurate,” comparing 9. 193 “mittique viros, qui certa reportent” with Sil. 1. 684, “mittique viros, qui exacta reportent.” Ulysses reconnoitres alone Od. 10. 144 foll.\n" +

While however it may be granted that ‘crispans’ is a strong expression for the motion of the spear merely as carried in the hand in walking, it must be remembered that it is hazardous to assume that one expression is put for another, which itself has no example in the Latin language. Hom.'s heroes carry two spears. “Lato venabula ferro” 4. 131.\n" +

Macrobius had already observed (Sat. 5. 11) that Venus to some extent performs the part of Nausicar in Od. 6. ‘Gerere’ of an assumed appearance 12. 472. Wagn. rightly understands the meaning to be “virginis os habitumque gerens, et virginis arma vel Spartanae vel Thressae.” Venus assumes the face and appearance of a virgin and the accoutrements of a huntress.\n" +

				"[317] Harpalyce. There is more than one mythological character of this name; but the one meant here appears to be a Thracian princess who took to the woods upon the dethronement of the king her father. The MSS. have ‘Hebrum.’ Rutgers conjectured ‘Eurum,’ which has been received by several editors, including Heyne and Ribbeck, on the ground that it is no proof of swiftness to outrun a river, and that Hebrus in particular, as Serv. remarks, is not swift. Wagn. and Forb. however rightly defend the MSS. reading, as in perfect conformity with classical usage, and particularly supported by Sil. 2. 73, “Quales Threiciae Rhodopen Pangaeaque lustrant Saxosis nemora alta jugis cursuque fatigant Hebrum innupta manus.” The Thracian huntress outstrips the rivers of her own country. A similar attempt has been made to correct the text of Hor. Od. 1. 25. 20, where see Macleane's note. Heyne, Wagn., and Forb. take ‘equos fatigat’ as ‘presses her horses,’ “quod proprium Amazonibus.” But Serv.'s explanation, ‘tires by outrunning them,’ is supported by the imitation from Silius just quoted (comp. also Sil. 3. 307), and corresponds with the story of Harpalyce, very circumstantially given by Serv. In Soph. Ant. 981 foll. (a passage which corresponds remarkably with this story of Harpalyce), we have the expression Βορεὰς ἅμιππος. Comp. Jeremiah 12. 5, “If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses?” Both ‘praevertor’ and ‘praeverto’ are used in this sense: comp. 7. 807., 12. 345. ‘Fuga’ of rapid movement in general, G. 3. 142, 201.\n" +

				"[318] Humeris suspenderat arcum: τόξ᾽ ὤμοισιν ἔχων, Il. 1. 45. The bow, and sometimes the arrows, appears to have been placed in the bow-case, or γωρυτός (10. 169, “Gorytique leves humeris”), and so slung over the shoulder. See Dict. A. ‘arcus.’ ‘Habilem’ is perhaps best taken closely with ‘suspenderat,’ the bow being slung conveniently. Comp. 9. 305, “habilem vagina aptarat eburna.” ‘De more’ is explained by v. 315 above, v. 336 below.\n" +

Hor. 1 Od. 26. 2, “Tradam protervis in mare Creticum Portare ventis.” It is difficult to obtain an exact grammatical analysis of the expression, which may be explained either by making ‘comam diffundere’ jointly the object of ‘dederat’ (‘gave the dishevelling of her hair to the winds’), or by making ‘comam’ the object and ‘diffundere’ an epexegetical acc. (‘her hair, namely, its dishevelling’); or, lastly, by making ‘comam’ the object and ‘diffundere’ a cognate acc. expressing the effect of the gift.\n" +

				"[320] Nuda genu, i. e. her tunic did not reach the knee. Ov., M. 10. 536, “Nuda genu, vestem ritu succincta Dianae” (quoted by Forb.). A representation of Diana with her tunic girt up above the knee, and the folds gathered into a knot or bunch on the breast, is given in Dict. A. ‘chlamys.’ It is difficult however, on a comparison of parallel passages (4. 139., 11. 776; Stat. Theb. 4. 265; Claud. Cos. Prob. et Olyb. 1. 89), to determine whether the ‘sinus’ is the folds of the tunic or the chlamys, and whether the ‘nodus’ is the knot or bunch into which the folds were gathered, the brooch, or the belt. The usage of Virg. seems in favour of taking ‘nodus’ strictly of a knot. Comp. 6. 301. Heyne's note on this passage is perhaps scarcely consistent with his third Excursus on Aen. 11.\n" +

A. ‘chlamys.’ ‘Pharetram,’ which is found in some inferior MSS. and (from a correction) in Rom., would seem to have been an old reading, as Priscian, p. 1081, says “pharetram . . . . sed melius in quibusdam codicibus sine m pharetra ablativus invenitur: quidam tamen lyncis cursum a communi accipiunt,” a strange interpretation. Madvig however would take ‘cursum’ with ‘lyncis’ as well as with ‘apri:’ and Ribbeck, Prolegom. p. 328, admitting the justice of the objection to this, that “tegmen” is the hide of a dead beast, not the skin of a living one, would adopt ‘tegmina’ from Gud. (originally), supposing that ‘tegmina lyncis prementem’ could mean ‘hunting the lynx for its hide.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[324] Apri cursum prementem is opposed to ‘errantem.’ ‘Clamore prementem;’ see G. 3. 419, where the dogs, to which ‘clamore’ refers, are the principal subject of the paragraph. ‘Apri cursum’ = “aprum currentem,” a boar that has broken covert. See Hor. Epod. 5. 28, and Macleane's note.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[326] Audita is commonly rendered ‘heard of;’ in which sense “auditus” is frequently coupled with “visus,” even in the case of persons. Here however there would be no particular force in it, and it seems better, on the whole, to follow the suggestion of Serv., and suppose the reference to be to ‘clamore.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[327] ‘O,’ as Wund. remarks, should have been followed by a vocative of the name of the goddess; for he is sure she is a goddess (‘O Dea certe’), though he knows not what goddess. Wund. comp. Demosth. de Cor. p. 232, Εἶτ᾽ ὦ—τί ἂν εἰπὼν δέ τις ὀρθῶς προσείποι;—ἔστιν ὅπου κ.τ.λ. To which may be added Aristoph., Clouds, 1378, ὦ τί σ᾽ εἴπω; Weidner refers to a passage in Ad Herenn. 4. 4, “tu istud ausus es dicere, homo omnium mortalium —quonam te digno moribus tuis appellem nomine?” which is given as an example of oratorical “dubitatio.” There is probably some sense of solemnity in ‘memorem.’ ‘Virgo’ is not to be pointed as a separate interrogative sentence (‘what shall I call thee? a virgin?’), as some have supposed, the word being applicable to a goddess as well as to a mortal maiden. ‘Haud—nec’ 7. 203 note.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[328] Hominem sonat: “humanum sonat” would be the common idiom. Persius however (3. 21) has “sonat vitium.” “Sapimus patruos” (Pers. 1. 11) is a similar expression. There is a slight similarity to this passage in Od. 6. 149 foll., and a somewhat stronger one in Apoll. R. 4. 1411 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[329] Heyne appears to be right in dividing this line into two separate questions. Hand's notion (Tursell. 1. 315) that it is a case similar to those in which ‘certe’ follows “nescio an,” ‘whether or not—at all events,’ seems far-fetched. Looking to ‘una,’ it seems better to take ‘sanguinis’ as equivalent to “generis” (“sanguis meus,” 6. 835), not as an attributive genitive. Comp. however 6. 778, “Assaraci quam sanguinis Ilia mater Educet.” Perhaps it may be regarded here as a confusion of two modes of expression.\n" +

				"[330] Sis felix, ‘be propitious.’ Comp. E. 5. 65, “Sis bonus o felixque tuis.” Wund., following a hint of Heyne, thinks it may stand for χαῖρε, which is so common in Greek hymns; but the passage just cited is against this. ‘Quaecumque (es),’ a sort of vocative clause: comp. 8. 122, “Egredere o quicumque es.” For the thought comp. Od. 16. 183.\n" +

It is undoubtedly true, as Wagn. says, that the former rhythm is that which we most frequently find in Virg.'s hexameters. The other however is by no means uncommon. It is therefore a question of ear in the particular passage, and the fuller close which, as Pierius says, is produced by ‘et vastis’ seems appropriate here.\n" +

				"[348] Medios is the reading of Med. and some other MSS.; but ‘medius’ is the idiomatic expression, and the origin of the variation is obvious. Serv. and Donatus connect these words with the preceding line, so as to make ‘omnis’ the antecedent to ‘quos,’ “ac si diceret, Sceleratior Atreo et Thyeste, vel Eteocle et Polynice;” but this punctuation, though approved by Trapp, is clearly less natural. ‘Furor’ may perhaps refer to the unnatural character of the quarrel, as in Hor. Epod. 7. 13, Lucan 1. 8.\n" +

Ov. Her. 7. 127; and this is doubtless included in the notion of the word here: but that it also denotes impiety in our sense is plain from such passages as 2. 163. ‘Aras,’ the altar of the Penates.

				"[354] Burm., followed by the recent editors, places a semicolon at ‘coniugis,’ and a comma at ‘miris;’ but ‘ora modis attollens pallida miris’ is obviously a description of ‘imago.’ Comp. Lucr. 1.123, “simulacra modis pallentia miris,” already copied by Virg. G. 1. 477. See on 10. 822. ‘Attollens’ in fact expands ‘venit,’ much as Byron makes the witch of Endor call up Samuel in the words, “Samuel, raise thy buried head!”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[355] Crudelis aras, not unlike “crudelis terras,” 3. 44. There the co-operation of the country in the crime of its king might be assumed naturally; here it is uncertain whether the Penates are those of Pygmalion, and so concerned in the murder, or those of Sychaeus, and so merely witnesses of it. Perhaps 4. 21, Ov. Her. 7. 113, point rather to the latter, which is also more probable if we suppose that Dido is made actually to see the altar and the treasure (see on next line). On the other hand, we should more naturally think of the crime as perpetrated, like that of Atreus, in the house of the murderer, and the concealment would then have been more easy. But where the data are so few conjecture degenerates into licence.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[356] Nudavit will bear the general sense of ‘revealed,’ which is applicable to both the objects of the verb (see Forc.); but it is more probably to be referred specially to ‘pectora,’ so that we shall have a zeugma. Whether the poet intended a vision strictly speaking or a dream, is not quite clear; if the former, ‘nudavit’ and ‘tellure recludit’ must be taken of words spoken by the apparition; if the latter, Dido was actually made to see the altar and the cavern where the treasure lay. The former seems more consistent with analogy; but the latter is supported by 2. 297, where Hector, after appearing in much the same way as Sychaeus here, brings out the sacred things from the penetralia. ‘Domus scelus,’ ‘the domestic crime,’ as perpetrated by her brother, not as perpetrated before the Penates.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[361] Crudele seems to mean ‘fierce,’ or ‘savage.’ Serv. and others call it a hypallage, and probably the juxtaposition of ‘tyranni’ partially accounts for the epithet. ‘Metus acer’ occurs again 3. 682, of the Trojans escaping from the Cyclops. The epithets here are emphatic. The word ‘tyrannus’ in Virgil sometimes seems to bear a neutral sense, but more frequently it occurs in connexions which imply the notion of arbitrary if not of abused power. Here the circumstances of the story rather remind us of Greeks flying from a τύραννος.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[364] The ‘opes’ are evidently the ‘aurum;’ not, as Henry and after him Forb. suppose, the resources which constituted the power of Pygmalion, a sense which would not well agree with ‘portantur.’ Pygmalion may not have actually taken possession of the treasures, but they were his from the time when he slew their owner. The epithet ‘avari’ should be remarked. The wealth for which he has committed the crime is wafted away from him over the sea. The expression is meant to be terse and almost epigrammatic, as ‘dux femina facti’ shows. Comp. Dido's words Ov.

Byrsa, whence the legend of the bull's hide (βύρσα) arose, appears to have been the Greek corruption of Bosra, the Phoenician name for the citadel of Carthage. ‘Facti de nomine’ is copied by the author of the Ciris, v. 487.\n" +

Sat. 3. 2 fancies that ‘annalis’ is used with singular propriety, the “annales maxumi” at Rome being made by the Pontifex Maxumus, with which character Virg. is supposed to imply that Aeneas is invested. Virg.'s love of recondite half-allusions to traditions which he does not expressly adopt is unquestionable; but where, as here, there is no more than a possibility of such a reference, we may perhaps make the question one of poetical taste, which here would certainly seem to exclude anything of the sort. The word doubtless has a propriety of its own, but it is merely as suggesting the notion of a minute and rather tedious narrative.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[374] ‘Conponat.’ The MSS. authority is divided between ‘conponet’ (Med., Gud.) and ‘conponat’ (Rom., Pal., the latter however altered into ‘conponet’), ‘conponet’ being further supported by quotations in Macrob., Priscian, Nonius, and other early writers. The question is argued in favour of the future indicative by Forb. against Wagn., who in his large edition supports ‘conponat,’ but in his smaller edition tacitly admits ‘conponet.’ ‘Vacet,’ implying that the condition will not happen, separates this passage from such as “Si fractus illabatur orbis Impavidum ferient ruinae” (Hor. 3. Od. 3. 7), where it is implied that the condition may very conceivably happen, as Wagn. remarks. In the only strictly parallel passage quoted, Cic. Tusc. 5. 35. 102, “Dies deficiet, si velim paupertatis caussam defendere,” there is the same variety of reading as here. Being thus left to decide between the authority of MSS., which in a case like this proves little, and what would seem to be the propriety of language, I have preferred ‘conponat.’ ‘Clauso Olympo,’ closing the gates of heaven through which the day issues. Comp. the expression “porta caeli” G. 3. 261. Weidner refers to Il. 5. 749 foll. ‘Conponat,’ ‘would lay the day to sleep.’ Comp. G. 4. 189, “Post ubi iam thalamis se conposuere.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[375] Troia with ‘vectos.’ See Madv. § 275. ‘Per auris iit,’ passed through your ears and so entered your mind. A similar expression is found Lucr. 1.417, where, though the thought is different from that in the present line, it bears a strong resemblance to that in the lines immediately preceding. The whole passage is worth quoting, as showing the variety of small obligations which Virg. has incurred to his predecessor, now borrowing thoughts without words, now words without thoughts:— “Usque adeo largos haustus e fontibu' magnis Lingua meo suavis diti de pectore fundet, Ut verear ne tarda prius per membra senectus Serpat et in nobis vitai claustra resolvat Quam tibi de quavis una re versibus omnis Argumentorum sit copia missa per auris: Sed nunc ut repetam coeptum pertexere dictis. ”(412-418)With the sense generally Weidner comp. Od. 15. 403, εἴ που ἀκούεις.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[376] Diversa per aequora vectos may merely mean ‘over various seas,’ as in v. 756, “Omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus;” or we may take it with Heyne as ‘out of our course.’ He quotes Od. 9. 261 (which Virg. doubtless had in view, as the entire passage shows), Οἴκαδε ἱέμενοι, ἄλλην ὁδόν, ἄλλα κέλευθα Ἤλθομεν: but the other sense of ‘diversa’ might be sup ported from the previous lines, Ἡμεῖς τοι Τροίηθεν ἀποπλαγχθέντες Ἀχαιοὶ Παντοίοις ἀνέμοισιν ὑπὲρ μέγα λαῖτμα θαλάσσης.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[377] Forte sua is an adaptation of the phrase ‘sponte sua’ to the nature of the weather. The tempest drove us hither by mere accident without any purpose of ours. Contrast Ilioneus' language to Latinus 7. 213 foll., especially “consilio” v. 216.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[380] Some inferior MSS. which Burm. and Heyne follow, omit ‘et.’ The line would then run “Italiam quaero patriam; genus ab Iove summo,” ‘My country is Italy which I am seeking; my descent is from Jove.’ Retaining ‘et,’ we must of course couple ‘genus’ with ‘patriam.’ ‘I am on my way to Italy my country, and to my forefathers, sprung from Jove,’ referring not to his own descent from Jove through Venus, but to that of his nation through Dardanus. Comp. 3. 129, “Cretam proavosque petamus,” and see 7. 240 foll. Rom. has ‘Iove magno.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[381] Serv. considers ‘conscendere aequor’ to be said of physically climbing the sea,—“secundum physicos, qui dicunt terram inferiorem esse aqua, quia omne quod continetur supra illud est quod continet.” It would be more natural to suppose that the poet referred to some commoner appearance or sensation such as the elevation of the horizon or the rising of the wave; “climbing ever up the climbing wave” (Tennyson). ‘Conscendo’ however is so completely appropriated as a technical term for embarking, being used in that sense even without an accusative, that we can hardly avoid giving it such a meaning in a connexion like this. Here as elsewhere (see on G. 2. 364) it seems that Virg. while he secured the sense ‘embark’ by the use of ‘conscendo,’ arranged his words so as to give him the advantage at the same time of some other ideas, of which that of climbing the wave just mentioned may have been one, and the notion opposed to “demittere” (“quove magis fessas optem demittere navis” 5. 29), whether of actual ascent or of effort, may have been another. ‘Navibus’ constructed as in 10. 213, “ter denis navibus ibant.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[382] Serv. thinks there is an allusion to the legend that Aeneas was led by the star of Venus to Italy: see note on 2. 801. ‘Fata,’ oracles. Comp. 3. 444, “quae rupe sub ima Fata canit;” and 4. 345, “Sed nunc Italiam magnam Grynaeus Apollo, Italiam Lyciae iussere capessere sortes.” The oracle itself is given 3. 94 by Apollo at Delos.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[383] Undis Euroque with ‘convolsae,’ not, as Serv. suggests as an alternative, with ‘supersunt.’ The two however come virtually to the same thing, as the meaning seems to be ‘survive the strain of wind and wave.’\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[387] Od. 3. 27, οὐ γὰρ ὀΐω Οὔ σε θεῶν ἀέκητι γενέσθαι τε τραφέμεν τε. In ‘quisquis es’ Venus seems to speak as a Tyrian maiden, to whom the history of Troy is unknown. ‘Auras vitalis’ is common in Lucr., 3. 405, 575., 5. 857., 6. 1227.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[389] The commentators have been unable to find instances of “se perferre ad aliquem locum.” “Se ferre ad aliquem locum” however is common enough, and “per” is naturally prefixed here as Aeneas is bidden to go on till he reaches the palace.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[390] The ‘namque’ refers to her injunction to go straight without further anxiety to the palace. ‘Relatam’ is to be explained by ‘reduces,’ ‘brought back to haven.’ A few MSS. have ‘receptam.’\n" +

				"[391] The wind has shifted, and instead of driving it into danger now drives it into safety.\n" +

				"[392] Vani, false pretenders. Comp. 2. 80, “vanum etiam mendacemque inproba finget.” She sees the swans, and professes to interpret the omen on the spot by the rules her parents have given her. The parents are those of the supposed huntress, not, as Donatus, “maiores nostri.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[393] The swans are the birds of Venus, and their number is that of the missing ships. Serv. quotes Aemilius Macer in his ὀρνιθογονία, “Cycnus in augurio nautis gratissimus augur: Hunc optant semper, quia nunquam mergitur undis.” ‘Agmine,’ ‘in order,’ is opposed to ‘turbabat,’ and explained by ‘ordine longo.’ Comp. “agmen” in v. 186, contrasted with “miscet” in v. 191. Connect ‘laetantis agmine,’ ‘in jubilant order.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[394] Aetheria lapsa plaga, ‘swooping from the sky;’ the ‘aetheria plaga’ being higher than the ‘caelum.’ ‘Aperto caelo,’ ‘the wide air,’ harmonizing with ‘turbabat.’ As Forb. remarks, it is parallel to the wide ocean over which the ships were tossed. Forb. well comp. Ov. M. 6. 692, “Idem ego [Boreas], cum fratres caelo sum nactus aperto (Nam mihi campus is est), tanto molimine luctor.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[396] This line seems to answer in structure and therefore probably in sense to v. 400. Its meaning has been the subject of much controversy; the word ‘capere’ being variously understood either as to settle on or to mark out for settling (“capere oculis”), which latter would agree with the military sense of “locum capere.” The difficulty in each case consists in the words ‘captas despectare,’ which could not very naturally, as Henry thinks, stand for the action of the swans rising again and hovering over the place where they had settled, while Wagn.'s view (in his smaller edition), that some mark their ground, others look down on it after having marked it, is open to the obvious objection that such a distinction could not possibly be observed or pointed out by a spectator. It seems best then, with Burm., to take ‘captas’ in the sense of “captas ab altera cycnorum parte,” so that the sense would be, ‘some alight, others still hover in the air and look down on those who have alighted.’ ‘Iam’ expresses that they are just looking down on their companions and already preparing to follow them. ‘Coetu cinxere polum’ is no objection to this interpretation, as Henry thinks, those words being evidently ornamental and only vaguely descriptive. Ribbeck's ‘capsos respectare’ (‘respectare,’ Pal.) is a sufficiently unhappy conjecture, introducing a most un-Virgilian word. ‘Captos’ however is read by Pal. (corrected) and Gud.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[397] This and the following line express no more than the joy of the swans at their safety, the exact parallel between the swans and the ships having been anticipated at v. 396. ‘As surely as the swans are rejoicing in their safety, so surely shall you see your ships safe again.’ ‘Reduces’ answers to ‘reduces’ in v. 390, the swans rallied from their confusion corresponding to the Trojans returning to port after the storm. Hom. has a simile from an eagle swooping on a flock of swans, Il. 15. 690.\n" +

Ῥοδοδάκτυλος ἠώς in Homer is not a parallel, as the colour there does not stand simply for beauty. In Il. 3. 396 the first of several marks by which Helen recognizes Aphrodite is the beauty of her neck. ‘Avertens’ v. 104 above. ‘Refulsit’ probably expresses the sudden burst of splendour. Comp. v. 588 below, 2. 590, Hor. 1 Od. 12. 27, and Pers. Prol. 12.\n" +

The expression must therefore refer to the feeling that he has been generally mocked and baffled. ‘Falsis imaginibus’ may be equivalent to “fallendo imagines,” by assuming shapes not your own, by counterfeiting shapes, as in v. 683, though the contrast would still be intended with ‘verae voces.’\n" +

				"[411] Aer is here used in the sense of the Homeric ἀὴρ, ‘mist,’ which sense however Virg. could only determine by the addition of the epithet ‘obscuro.’ See on 5. 20, “in nubem cogitur aer.” This and the three following lines are an imitation of Od. 7. 14—17. See also Apoll. R. 3. 210 foll.\n" +

				"[412] Nebulae amictu: from Il. 15. 308, εἱμένος ὤμοιιν νεφέλην, imitated by Hor. 1 Od. 2. 31, “Nube candentis humeros amictus.” There is a tmesis in ‘circum fudit,’ as ‘fudit’ alone would have required “multum amictum.” ‘Dea’ is added rhetorically, expressing the divine power exerted in the action of the line. So exactly vv. 691, 692 below. Comp. also vv. 195, 196 above. The use of the word here may very possibly have been suggested to Virg. by Il. 3. 380 foll., τὸν δ᾽ ἐξήρπαξ᾽ Ἀφροδίτη Ῥεῖα μάλ᾽, ὥστε θεός: ἐκάλυψε δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἠέρι πολλῇ. \n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[415] Sublimis, through the air. “Sublimis abit” occurs Livy 1. 16, of the ascent of Romulus, Id. ib. 34, of the eagle that took off Tarquin's cap. Virg. was thinking of Od. 6. 41, as well as of the passage quoted on the next line.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[416] Laeta probably to be contrasted with “tristior” v. 228. Heyne and Wagn. take it as having reference to her love for Paphos. Serv. suggests that ‘laeta’ is the fixed epithet of Venus; and φιλομμειδὴς actually occurs in the passage quoted immediately below, from which this is verbally imitated. Virg. however cannot have meant ‘laeta’ for a fixed epithet, though it is possible that he may have mistaken the character of the fixed epithet, and supposed that it was meant to have a special reference to the context, like some of the critics on Homer. Henry (Class. Mus.) once thought it more poetical to make ‘calent’ the verb to ‘templum’ as well as ‘arae’ than to understand ‘est’ with ‘templum.’ But the words are clearly imitated from Od. 8. 362, Ἡ δ᾽ ἄρα Κύπρον ἵκανε φιλομμειδὴς Ἀφροδίτη Ἐς ΙΙάφον: ἔνθα δέ οἱ τέμενος, βωμός τε θυήεις, where θυήεις answers to ‘calent’ and ‘halant’ here. How Virg. came to develope the single altar of Hom. into a hundred does not appear: probably it arose from his turn for amplifying, as in G. 3. 18, A. 4. 199. The commentators observe that sacrifices of blood were not offered to Venus, citing Tac. H. 2. 3 (in Catull. 64 (66). 90 foll. the reading and interpretation are doubtful). Horace however, 1 Od. 19. 16, and 4 Od. 11. 7, refers to a different practice. ‘Sertis,’ festoons.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[421] Comp. Od. 7. 43, where Ulysses first sees the city of the Phaeacians. Virgil too may have had his eye on Apoll. R. 3. 215 foll. ‘Molem,’ the vast buildings. Hor. 3 Od. 29. 10, “Fastidiosam desere copiam et Molem propinquam nubibus arduis.” ‘Magalia,’ apparently the same as “mapalia” G. 3. 340, where see note. The word, which is a Punic one, occurs again 4. 259, Plaut. Poen. prol. 86. In these two places it seems simply to mean suburbs (comp. the fragments of Sall. and Cassius Hemina cited by Serv.); here there is evidently a disparaging sense intended, as we should say, mere huts. The contrast, as Serv. remarks, is in the poet's own mind, not in that of Aeneas. Comp. 8. 360.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[422] Strepitum, the hum of the crowded streets. “Omitte mirari beatae Fumum et opes strepitumque Romae,” Hor. l. c. ‘Strata viarum’ is from Lucr. 1.315 (where see Munro), 4. 415. ‘Paved streets.’ The expression, which, as Madv. (§ 284, obs. 5) remarks, hovers between the partitive notion and that of quality, is used more boldly by Lucr. than by Virg., e. g. “prima virorum.” \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[423] A semicolon is commonly placed at ‘Tyrii;’ but ‘insto’ is found with an infin. 2. 627, Lucr. 4.998. ‘Pars—pars:’ part are at work on the fortifications, part on the houses. Such seems the general distinction; but there is no occasion, with Forb., to suppose that ‘muri’ must be the walls of the citadel, as if ‘pars’ could only mean a party actually engaged in the same work on the same spot. It is doubtful whether ‘ducere muros,’ which occurs here and in Hor. 4 Od. 6. 23, means ‘to trace’ or ‘to build’ (carry) the wall. Serv. quotes a fragment from Sall. Hist. 2 (“Murum ab angulo dextri lateris ad paludem haud procul remotam duxit”) which makes for the latter interpretation; and so the Greek phrase ἐλαύνειν τοῖχον, which occurs, according to one reading, in a passage of Hom. (Od. 7. 86), immediately following that which Virg. has just been imitating.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[424] Moliri, ‘to build,’ as in 3. 132, Hor. A. P. 399. ‘Arcem,’ the citadel proper, as distinguished from the ‘arces,’ v. 420. ‘Subvolvere saxa,’ to roll them up to the eminence on which the citadel was being built.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[425] Optare, ‘to choose,’ as in 3. 119, 132. There is a reading ‘aptare,’ found in some MSS., including Rom. as originally written, and rather preferred by Henry, seemingly without reason. ‘Sulco’ is generally taken as the trench for the foundations. Lersch however (Antiqq. Vergg. § 19) understands ‘optare’ of choosing with auspices, and ‘concludere sulco’ of drawing a trench of demarcation round the houses, supposing that Virg. has transferred the solemnity of founding a city to the foundation of private dwellings. Henry makes ‘tecto’ general, so as to include citadel as well as private houses, supposing the distinction marked by ‘pars —pars,’ to be between actual building and laying out.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[426] Heyne and Ribbeck think this line spurious, as interrupting the enumeration of buildings; but legislation (“iura dare”) is mentioned in nearly the same connexion 3. 137., 5. 758. Virg. was probably thinking of the republican institutions of Rome and her colonies, without considering how this action of the people was to be reconciled with the authority of Dido (comp. v. 507). ‘Sanctus’ is the regular epithet of the Roman senate. ‘Iura magistratusque legunt’ is a zeugma, “iura constituunt magistratusque legunt,” as Forb. gives it.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[427] Effodiunt appears to be strictly correct, as the harbour of Carthage, which Serv. calls Cothon, was artificial. ‘Theatri’ is the reading of Med., ‘theatris’ of Rom., Pal. (originally), and fragm. Vat.; but the latter would be too great an exaggeration, and may easily have sprung from ‘portus,’ and ‘scaenis.’ For ‘alta’ fragm. Vat. has ‘lata,’ which Ribbeck adopts; but Weichert seems right in saying that the repetition of ‘alta,’ v. 429, is excused by the change of meaning.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[428] Ribbeck follows fragm. Vat. in reading ‘petunt’ for ‘locant,’ apparently regarding the latter as introduced from 4. 266; but such a thing is hardly probable in the face of authorities so independent as Med., Pal., and Rom. In the previous line he adopts ‘hinc’ from a quotation in Nonius, p. 340, who however has ‘locant,’ while fragm. Vat. apparently has ‘hic,’ so that not much can be made out of this coincidence. The temporary wooden theatre of M. Aemilius Scaurus had a ‘scaena’ of three stories, supported by 360 columns, Pliny 36. 15.\n" +

				"[430] Qualis apes exercet labor, ‘like the busy labour of bees.’ ‘Aestate nova:’ comp. G. 4. 52, note. ‘In the first bright days of summer,’ when the hive, awakened from its winter torpor, is busiest and most like a young colony. These lines are repeated with slight variations from G. 4. 162—169; a reference to which passage proves that the divisions here introduced by ‘cum’ imply, not different times, but different parties, and so are parallel to the different occupations of the Carthaginians. The variations are ‘liquentia’ for ‘purissima,’ and ‘dulci’ for ‘liquido;’ the first necessitated the second, and was natural in a passage where bees and honey are not the main subject celebrated, but only an illustration.\n" +

Serv., and Pomponius Sabinus; and it is recommended both by harmony and as the less usual expression. It is not easy to establish an argument on any peculiar construction of ‘laetus’ according to its senses, as it seems to have no uniform meaning with either case. “Laeta laborum,” 11. 73, may possibly mean ‘prodigal of her labour;’ but it is as likely to mean ‘delighting in the task.’ For sacred groves in cities, see Livy 1. 8.\n" +

Caelius Rhodius (referred to by Taubmann) says that Cacabe, the old name of Carthage, meant a horse's head, which, if true, would account for the legend. A horse's head is common on Punic coins. ‘Acris equi’ is paraphrased by Silius (2. 411), “bellator equus.” In 3. 539 (“bello armantur equi”) horses are taken as an omen of war.\n" +

G. 2. 460, “Fundit humo facilem victum iustissima tellus” (of which expression this, as Heyne remarks, is only a variety), and A. 8. 318, “asper victu venatus.” Cerda comp. the Homeric θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες, and “facillime agitis,” Ter. Adelph. 3. 4. 56, is cited by Serv. ‘Bello egregiam et facilem victu’ thus answers to the two characteristics of Carthage v. 14, “dives opum studiisque asperrima belli.” Sen. Ep. 90, as Cerda remarks, uses the expression in an opposite sense, “sapiens victu facilis,” ‘easy of maintenance.’ The horse may be a symbol of plenty, either as an appendage of wealth, or because a war-horse is high fed.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[447] Condebat seems to imply that the work was not complete, though Weidner thinks otherwise. ‘Opulentum donis et numine’ is a zeugma, ‘enriched by offerings and by the especial presence of the goddess.’ See on “coluisse,” v. 16. There was doubtless a statue, though this is implied rather than expressed by ‘numen’ both here and 4. 204. Something of the same conjunction of notions appears in “pinguis et placabilis ara,” 7. 764., 9. 585, where the thought seems to be ‘richly gifted and therefore propitious,’ or ‘richly gifted because believed to be propitious.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[448] Limen, in its strict sense. The threshold was of brass, with steps leading up to it. The latter particular is an ornamental one, and need not be understood as if the steps were of brass also. Brazen thresholds are Homeric, e. g. Od. 7. 89, of the palace of Alcinous, ἀργύρεοι δὲ σταθμοὶ ἐν χαλκέῳ ἕστασαν οὐδῷ, a passage which may have been in Virg.'s mind. The next clause presents a greater difficulty. All the first-class MSS. seem to have ‘nexaeque’ (Wagn. excepts fragm. Vat., but Ribbeck is silent); ‘nixaeque’ is mentioned by Serv., found in some MSS., and adopted by Wagn. (ed. mi.), Forb., Henry, Ladewig, and Haupt. The external authority is quite sufficient to support the change, which is itself a very natural one (see on 4. 217., 5. 279, G. 4. 257); but its advocates are not agreed on the sense. Henry and Forb. take ‘trabes’ of the beams of the roof, which rest on brazen columns. Wagn. makes ‘trabes’ the doorposts, and understands ‘nixae aere’ in the sense of “stantes erectae aere,” simply a periphrasis for ‘brazen.’ Ladewig makes ‘trabes’ the architrave, which rests on pillars or jambs of brass. Of these the third seems the only one that can stand, the first being objectionable as introducing a particular about the rest of the building between two particulars about the door; the second as giving a forced and unnatural sense to ‘nixae aere.’ Understanding ‘trabes’ with Wagn. of the doorposts, I believe ‘nexae aere’ stands for “aeratae,” as “vinctae” or “iunctae” might have done, the word being employed, not only to express the coherence of the plating with the thing plated, but to indicate the coherence of the posts with the threshold and the lintel, much as in Soph. El. 837 (which Wund. comp.) χρυσοδέτοις ἕρκεσι is used of the necklace of Eriphyle, in the sense of ‘gold-binding,’ rather than in that of ‘gold-bound.’ Perhaps Claud. Rapt. Pros. 1. 237 (cited by Heyne) means the same thing when he says “ferrati postes inmensaque nectit Claustra chalybs,” ‘strengthens and fastens them, so as to make them good fasteners.’ ‘Surgebant’ is probably to be supplied to ‘trabes;’ but ‘nexae aere’ will still be a predicate.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[449] ‘The doors with their grating hinges were of brass.’ We hear both of brazen and of brass-bound doors. The conjunction of brazen doors with brassplated jambs seems merely a variety. “Stridentes cardine portae,” 6. 573.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[452] There seems no reason for separating ‘confidere’ from ‘adflictis rebus,’ and taking the latter as “in adflictis rebus,” as the commentators propose. The sense appears to be, “confidere fortunae quae adhuc adversa fuerat.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[453] These representations are probably on the doors or external walls of the temple. Comp. the sculptures mentioned G. 3. 26, A. 6. 20. ‘Sub’ then will express that Aeneas is looking up. Heyne discusses in an excursus the question whether these were sculptures or paintings, observing that the former was the only mode of representation known in the Homeric times, and that other poets, such as Val. Fl. 5. 411 foll., Sil. 3. 32 foll., describe similar temples with sculptures; but that the latter is more suited to the language of the present passage, and would be a natural anachronism, paintings on temple-walls or in porticoes being common in later times. There is a similar question about the description of the temple of Delphi in the Ion of Euripides.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[454] It has been asked how Aeneas knew that Dido was coming. Probably the idea is that he sees the senate assembled and the crowd waiting. ‘Quae Fortuna sit urbi miratur,’ for “miratur Fortunam urbis,” marvels at the prosperity of the city, shown in the splendour of its temple. Aeneas sees everything in the light of his own great enterprise; so his thoughts would naturally pass from the temple to the city, of whose greatness it is an evidence. For ‘Fortuna,’ see on G. 4. 209.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[455] Artificum manus inter se, ‘the skill of the rival artists,’ which he compares together. One or two MSS. have ‘intra se,’ whence Ribbeck needlessly and unpoetically conjectures ‘intrans.’ ‘Manus’ of skill 12. 210, as elsewhere of strength. ‘Operumque laborem’ probably refers to the magnitude of work rather than to the elaborate detail. Comp. G. 2. 155, “Adde tot egregias urbes operumque laborem.”\n" +

				"[456] ‘He sees the battles and heroes of the Trojan war.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[457] This line gives the reason why the battles have been painted, and prepares us for the thoughts that follow.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[458] The two Atridæ are first mentioned in the enumeration of the heroes, then Priam; after which Achilles is naturally introduced as ‘saevus ambobus,’ i. e. to the Atridae no less than to Priam. This seems a sufficient explanation of the loose use of ‘ambobus,’ with which ἀμφοτέροις in Od. 4. 339 has been aptly compared. The other objection that Achilles' quarrel was with Agamemnon alone, is of little weight, as the brothers were united in interest, and Menelaus as the husband of Helen suffered most. Achilles includes both in his taunts Il. 1. 159., 9. 340. Sen. Ep. 104 quotes the passage with ‘Atriden.’\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[466] Comp. E. 6. 31, “Namque canebat, uti” &c. Weidner arranges the various pictures into two groups of four scenes each: but the notion, though ingenious, seems fanciful.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[468] Curru ablative, not dative. The crest of Achilles is described Il. 19. 380, and again 22. 314 foll., just as he is going to give Hector his death-wound, so that we are doubtless intended to be reminded of its terrors.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[469] For the story of Rhesus see Il. 10, and the play of that name ascribed to Euripides. ‘Niveis tentoria velis’ is an anachronism. The Homeric κλίσιαι, as appears from Il. 24. 448, were huts of planks thatched with grass.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[470] Primo somno is proved by a number of instances (2. 268., 5. 857) to mean ‘in their first and deepest sleep;’ not, as Wagn. thinks, the first time they slept at Troy. ‘Prodita,’ betrayed to him, and so surprised. Possibly Henry may be right in making ‘somno’ instrumental, ‘betrayed by sleep.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[471] Vastabat tentoria, was spreading havoc through them. Perhaps it is more forcible to take ‘multa caede’ with ‘vastabat:’ ‘with wide carnage;’ not with ‘cruentus,’ ‘covered with much blood.’ But the point is very doubtful.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[472] Ardentis is the Homeric αἴθωνας. ‘Ardentis equos’ 7. 781. One MS. has ‘albentis,’ which was the colour of the horses of Rhesus, Il. 10. 437. But the mention of the colour as exactly represented here might be thought rather jejune, especially after ‘niveis velis.’ ‘Avertit,’ as “avertere praedas” 10. 78.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[473] Gustassent—bibissent. The subj. denotes the intention of Diomede. Homer and the Pseudo-Euripides know nothing of this intention, which Eustathius on Il. 10. 435, and the Scholiast, followed by Serv. on this passage, say was to prevent the accomplishment of an oracle that if the horses of Rhesus tasted the grass or water of Troy, Troy should not be taken.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[474] Troilus is mentioned by Priam, Il. 24. 257, with the epithet of ἱππιοχάρμης, as having been killed in battle (before the time of the Iliad). The tradition that he was killed by Achilles must have been drawn by Virg. from other sources, such as those represented by Quintus Smyrnaeus, Tzetzes, Dictys, and Dares, who however differ about the period in the Trojan war when his death occurred. Heyne conjectures from a Schol. on Hom. l. c. that Soph. in his lost tragedy of Troilus represented the youth as surprised by Achilles while exercising his chariot, and killed. See his Excursus on this passage. Plautus, Bacchid. 4. 9. 29 foll., speaks of the death of Troilus as one of the three fatal events in the siege of Troy, the other two being the loss of the Palladium and the fall of the top of the Scaean gate. Ribbeck transposes this passage so as to make it follow the next scene; but this would be to bind Virg. to follow servilely the Homeric order, with which indeed there would still be a disagreement, as in Hom. the mission to the temple of Athene precedes the Dolonea. The intention of Virg. doubtless is to mention first two fatal blows to Troy, and then the despairing effort of the Trojan women to propitiate the angry goddess.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[475] Atque couples ‘inpar congressus’ with ‘infelix.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[476] Fertur equis, is run away with. G. 1. 513, “frustra retinacula tendens Fertur equis auriga neque audit currus habenas.” He has fallen backwards from the car (which of course had no back), but hangs by the reins, which were passed round the body, and which he still grasps with his hand. ‘Hasta’ is the spear of Troilus. Virg., as Heyne remarks, has departed from the Homeric custom, in which two warriors ride in the same car, one to drive and the other to fight. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[477] Heyne justly wonders that Quinct. (7. 9) should raise a question whether ‘tamen’ goes with what precedes or with what follows.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[478] Pulvis inscribitur like “flores inscripti” E. 3. 106.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[479] Non aequae, unpropitious. Comp. G. 2. 225, “vacuis Clanius non aequus Acerris.” This scene is described in Il. 6. 297 foll., which is imitated by Virg. himself 11. 477 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[481] Suppliciter, as Henry says, gives the general effect, and so should be pointed off. The ‘suppliant guise’ is further described in the words that follow.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[482] Hom. Il. 6. 311 has Ὣς ἔφατ᾽ εὐχομένη, ἀνένευε δὲ ΙΙαλλὰς Ἀθήνη. The contrary attitude is described in Ovid, Trist. 1. 3. 45, “Ad vatem voltus rettulit illa (Venus) suos.” Here there is of course a confusion between the goddess and her statue.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[483] This line suggests the mangled and pitiable state of the body as shown in the picture,—a condition such as is described 2. 272. The tense of ‘raptaverat’ shows that this is not a separate picture. Comp. 8. 642—4, where the tense of “distulerant” similarly shows that the tearing of the limbs asunder had taken place before the action represented on the shield, which is similarly marked by the imperfect. In Hom. Hector is chased round the walls and dragged round the tomb of Patroclus. Heyne supposes Virg. to have followed the Cyclic poets or one of the tragedians, as Eur. Androm. 105 has τὸν περὶ τείχη Εἵλκυσε διφρεύων παῖς ἁλίας Θέτιδος. The word ‘raptaverat’ is apparently from Ennius, Androm. fr. 12, “Hectorem curru quadriiugo raptarier.” The scene is from Il. 24. 478 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[484] Exanimum perhaps = “ita exanimatum,” by the dragging: see on 2. 273. ‘Auro vendebat,’ 6. 621. See Madv. § 258.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[486] Currus has been differently taken as the chariot of Hector or that of Achilles. It might also be taken of that of Priam, described Il. 24. 266. The chariot of Achilles however would be a more important object in such a picture; and its presence seems to be indicated in v. 483. Statius has a parallel passage (Silv. 2. 7. 55) “Ludes Hectora Thessalosque currus Et supplex Priami potentis aurum.” \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[487] Inermis, unarmed, and so suppliant. The expression ‘tendere manus inermis’ occurs (with a variation of reading) 10. 595., 11. 414, 672. For the thing see Il. 24. 478.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[488] It is perhaps a little remarkable that Aeneas' features should have been transmitted by fame to Carthage, so as to be at once recognized by himself. In the other cases we may suppose that the event described told its own story. But names are found written over or under figures in old sculpture or painting, and Virg. may have had this practice in his mind, so that he would not seem to himself to be making a violent assumption. ‘Principibus permixtum,’ προμάχοις μιχθέντα. When Poseidon rescues Aeneas from Achilles, he tells him to keep in the background during Achilles' lifetime, but afterwards μετὰ πρώτοισι μάχεσθαι Il. 20. 338. Whether this time of more extended action is referred to here we cannot say, as we do not know how far the order of the pictures is chronological. Fragm. Vat. and Rom. give ‘adgnoscit,’ which Jahn adopts. This and the next line do not seem to represent any particular scene, though Weidner (see on v. 466) thinks otherwise. Were it so, we should probably have had a more definite description, as Aeneas himself figures in the action. The lines appear rather to be a summing up of various scenes not described in detail.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[489] The ‘Eoae acies’ are the Indian Aethiopians. Hom. says nothing of them in the Iliad, but Memnon is mentioned Od. 4. 187., 11. 521. Memnon had arms made by Vulcan, A. 8. 384. He was probably the hero of the Aethiopis of Arctinus, which is said to have followed immediately on the action of the Iliad (Mure, Hist. vol. ii. p. 282). He is called ‘niger’ as an Aethiopian, but the legend made him eminently beautiful, Od. 11. 521. On the whole subject see Heyne's Excursus.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[490] Penthesilea and her Amazons are again post-Homeric personages, who also seem to have figured in the Aethiopis, another title of the poem being probably Amazonia. Priam speaks of himself as having fought against Amazons invading Phrygia, Il. 3. 188. For ‘lunatis peltis,’ which were part of the national armour of various parts of Asia, and therefore attributed to the Amazons, see Dict. A. ‘pelta.’\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[493] Bellatrix placed as in 7. 805: comp. v. 319 above. ‘Viris concurrere virgo’ is supposed to be a reminiscence of the epithet ἀντιανείρας, applied by Hom. l. c. to the Amazons.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[494] Videntur apparently means ‘are seen’ rather than ‘seem’ (comp. “mihi visa” v. 326 above): ‘miranda’ however does not seem to be a pres. part. like “volvenda,” as Wagn. thinks, but rather means ‘are seen as marvels.’ Henry notes the propriety of ‘Dardanio,’ as Aeneas is overwhelmed by Dardan recollections. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[495] Comp. 7. 249, “defixa Latinus Obtutu tenet ora soloque inmobilis haeret,” which seems to show that ‘haeret’ is to be separated from ‘obtutu in uno’ here.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[497] Incessit conveys a notion of majesty, as “incedo” in v. 46. Weidner supposes ‘iuvenum’ to be young women, which would help out the simile, but seems otherwise quite improbable. Elsewhere we hear of no female companions of hers except her sister. “Saepta armis” below he understands of a male bodyguard following her and her train. For ‘stipante’ Rom. has ‘comitante.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[498] This simile is translated with minor variations from Od. 6. 102 foll. It is much less appropriate to Dido walking in the midst of her lords, than to Nausicaa dancing among her handmaidens, as was remarked long ago by Probus ap. Gell. 9. 9. ‘Per iuga Cynthi’ 4. 147. Hom. specifies Taygetus (in Laconia, like Eurotas) or Erymanthus. For Eurotas comp. E. 6. 83.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[499] Exercet choros like “exercent palaestras” 3. 281. The first syllable of ‘Diana’ is elsewhere short in Virg. Possibly he may have preferred the long antepenult in the nom., the short in the oblique cases.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[500] “Quem circum glomerati hostes hinc comminus atque hinc Proturbant,” 9. 440. The nymphs follow her, and as they throng, form a circle round her. ‘Illa pharetram fert humero’ is perhaps a translation of ἰοχέαιρα. Comp. note on v. 416. We may however be intended to think of the motion of the quiver on the shoulder, as in 4. 149, “Tela sonant humeris.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[501] For ‘deas’ Pal. and Rom. have ‘dea,’ which also may have been the first reading of Med. Henry prefers it, citing vv. 412, 692. But the lengthening of a final vowel is very unusual, though not unexampled (see on 3. 464), and the omission of the letter is easily accounted for (see on G. 2. 219). It may be said too that ‘deas’ is confirmed by Hom. l. c. ῥεῖά τ᾽ ἀριγνώτη πέλεται, καλαὶ δέ τε πᾶσαι, though ‘dea’ would have a force of its own. ‘Deae’ of inferior goddesses 9. 117., 10. 235.\n" +

				"[503] Se ferebat, ‘advanced,’ 5. 290 &c. Even where there is no word of motion in the sentence, as in 5. 372., 8. 199, it seems to indicate more than our word ‘carriage’ or ‘bearing,’ though that notion may be included, as here.\n" +

				"[505] The simplest way of reconciling ‘foribus’ and ‘media’ is to suppose that Dido sat in the centre of the entrance; the ‘testudo’ (vaulted roof) extending over the whole building. The idea is probably taken from meetings of the senate held in temples. But Henry (anticipated by Turneb. Adv. 10. 11) may be right in taking ‘foribus divae’ of the ‘cella’ within the temple, and supposing that Dido was seated on the landing-place of the flight of steps by which the ‘cella’ was commonly approached. He also remarks the general similarity between the reception of the Trojans here by Dido in the temple of Juno and by Latinus in the temple of Faunus 7. 170 foll. My lamented friend, Professor Shirley, suggested to me that the temple may have been a hypaethral one, which would have the ‘testudo’ over the door. Ribbeck reads ‘media e testudine,’ from a doubtful variety in Pal.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[506] Subnixa means supported from beneath, with the throne (‘solio’), not, as Heyne thinks, with a footstool. Henry comp. Claud. Epith. Hon. et Mar. 99, where ‘solio subnixa’ is similarly used. ‘Saepta armis,’ “satellitum scilicet,” Serv.\n" +

A. ‘ius.’ For ‘iura dare’ see on v. 293 above, 5. 758. ‘Operumque laborem’ foll. may be taken in two ways; either, that she divided by equity and, where that failed, by lot, which is the common way, or, that she first divided equally and then distributed the parts by lot. There is some resemblance between the scene here and that described Od. 11. 568 foll., though there the notion of administering justice is the prominent one, here that of giving laws and apportioning work.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[508] Partibus probably instr. or modal abl. ‘Sorte trahebat’ is an inverted expression, combining the common phrase “sortem trahere” with the notion of division. See note on v. 381, and comp. 2. 201., 5. 534 notes.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[513] Perculsus Med., Pal. corrected, ‘percussus’ fragm. Vat., Rom., Gud., Pal. originally. The latter has generally been adopted since Heins. The words are frequently confounded in MSS., and it is not easy to establish the distinction for which Forb. and others contend, as though ‘perculsus’ were too strong to be applied to any pleasurable emotion. Here however ‘perculsus’ is used in a sense peculiar to itself as a synonym of ‘obstipuit’ (was struck dumb), the ablatives referring to both words as if it had been ‘prae laetitia metuque.’ The words ‘perculsus’ and ‘stupeo’ are similarly joined in Hor. Epod. 7. 16, “Mentesque perculsae stupent.” Comp. also Tac. A. 1. 12, “Perculsus inprovisa interrogatione paullum reticuit.” ‘Perculsus’ should be restored to 8. 121, “Obstipuit tanto percussus nomine Pallas,” where it is read by Rom. In 9. 197 ‘percussus’ would seem to be the right word, being taken closely with ‘amore,’ as in G. 2. 476, where however, as there, the MSS. present the same variety. These passages seem also to show that ‘perculsus’ here is not an independent verb, but a participle, so that it is best to remove the comma after ‘ipse.’ ‘Simul—simul,’ 5. 675.\n" +

The MSS. however have less positive weight here, as it is evident that there has been a confusion between ‘cunctis’ and ‘lecti,’ some giving ‘cuncti lectis’ (Rom.), others ‘cunctis lectis’ (Gud. originally, Pal. corrected). The sense is strongly against ‘cuncti,’ whether we couple it with what follows, or, as Wagn., with what precedes. The appearance of deputies from all the ships informs Aeneas that the whole fleet is there (‘classem quo litore linquant’); whereas it is difficult to see the meaning of making him wonder why all the deputies came together. Strictly, no doubt, “omnes” means all, distributively, and “cuncti” the whole, as Jahn contends against the reading ‘cunctis:’ but there are repeated instances in which “cuncti” might be replaced by “omnes,” and even by “singuli,” G. 2. 42, A. 3. 398.\n" +

It must be admitted, however, that so far as ‘frenare’ goes, it would point rather to Dido's government of her own people. Henry thinks Ilioneus speaks of the two operations in which he has seen Dido engaged, directing the building of the city and legislating (vv. 507, 508).\n" +

				"[525] Infandos, unspeakable, and so, horrible; not, as Heyne thinks, lawless, a sense which the word does not appear to bear. The Carthaginians were treating the Trojans as pirates. “Prohibent a matribus haedos,” G. 3. 398.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[526] Heyne takes ‘propius’ as more closely; do not judge us by appearances. But it seems rather to mean, as Taubmann understood it, “praesentius,” incline thy ear to hear our case. Comp. 8. 78, “propius tua numina firmes.” The Trojans are called “pii” 3. 266., 7. 21.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[527] Venimus populare, vertere, like “parasitus modo venerat aurum petere,” Plaut. Bacch. 4. 3. 18, an instance which may show that the construction is not merely a poetical Grecism, though the supine is undoubtedly more usual than the inf. ‘Populare’ seems here to refer to slaughter, as distinguished from pillage (‘ad litora vertere praedas’). This is a sense however derived from the context, not, as Wagn. thinks, inherent in the word. Attius (Astyanax fragm. 1) has “Qui nostra per vim patria populavit bona.”\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[534] The reading ‘hic’ is supported against ‘huc’ apparently by all the best MSS., and Serv. The sense is of course the same with either reading, while ‘hic’ is the more difficult, ‘huc’ the simpler. See on 4. 46, where there is a similar variety, and comp. 4. 237, “hic nostri nuntius esto.” One inferior MS. fills up the line “huc cunctis [fuit?] ire voluntas.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[535] Subito adsurgens fluctu, rising with a sudden swell. ‘Orion adsurgens fluctu’ is another of those artifices noticed on vv. 381, 508, the word ‘adsurgens’ being intended to combine the rising of the star and the rising of the wave. For ‘adsurgens fluctu’ in the latter sense comp. G. 2. 160 and note; for the former comp. Val. Fl. 5. 566, “Qualibus adsurgens nox aurea cingitur astris.” We are reminded here rather of the follower of Hesiod and Aratus than of the imitator of Homer. The inconsistency was felt in Serv.'s time, many, as he says, putting the superfluous question why the rising of Orion is mentioned when the tempest was raised by Juno; to which he replies that Ilioneus was not aware of the facts which the poet learned from the Muse. Elsewhere storms are connected with the setting of Orion (7. 719, Hor. 1 Od. 28. 21., 3. 27. 17, Epod. 10. 10), as here with the rising. The rising of Orion is about midsummer (Pliny 18. 68), which agrees with the time here, v. 756.\n" +

				"[536] Procacibus, boisterous. Eupolis, quoted by Julius Pollux ap. Cerdam, calls the winds ἀσελγεῖς. Lucr. 6.111 has “petulantes aurae,” and Hor. 1 Od. 26. 2, “protervi venti.” ‘Penitus:’ above v. 512.\n" +

				"[537] Superante salo, either, the sea overpowering us (“vicit hiemps” v. 122) or the waves rising high. The former, implying that they were unable to make head and were driven before the wind, is perhaps more in accordance with the context; but both may be intended: comp. 2. 311 note. Henry thinks ‘salum’ is used here and 2. 209 in its technical sense of the sea near the shore, for which see Forc.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[538] Pauci, a poor remnant. Comp. 6. 744, “pauci laeta arva tenemus.” ‘Adnavimus,’ floated or drifted: comp. 4. 613., 6. 358. In prose the word is used of an ordinary approach to land; but Virg. doubtless meant something more. ‘Vestris oris’ is epexegetical of ‘huc:’ see on E. 1. 53.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[539] The first half of this line is said by Macrob. (Sat. 6. 1) to be taken from Furius (probably of Antium), whom according to the same authority Virg. largely imitated, “Quod genus hoc hominum, Saturno sancte create.” This confirms Wagner's punctuation, which places an interrogation after ‘hominum,’ instead of continuing the construction to ‘permittit.’ ‘Quod genus’ is probably to be explained by ‘quae patria,’ not, as might be argued from v. 542, by supposing ‘hominum’ to be emphatic. For ‘quae tam barbara permittit,’ comp. G. 2. 315, and note. ‘Patria morem permittit’ is equivalent to “terra morem sibi proprium permittit:” see on G. 1. 52, and comp. v. 51 above. There is the same notion in Catull. 10. 14, “quod illic Natum dicitur esse.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[540] There is a pathetic force in ‘hospitio;’ we are barred even from the welcome which the shore gives the shipwrecked man. Serv. refers to Cic. pro Rosc. Am. 26, “Nam quid est tam commune, quam spiritus vivis, terra mortuis, mare fluctuantibus, litus eiectis?” Comp. Ilioneus' language 7. 229 foll.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[543] Sperare in the sense merely of expectation, like ἐλπίζειν, is common. There is no occasion to understand ‘fore.’ ‘But expect gods who forget not the righteous or unrighteous deed.’ “Deos sperare” occurs Plaut. Cas. 2. 5. 38, Mil. 4. 5. 10, Cist. 2. 3. 52 in a somewhat different sense. ‘Fandi atque nefandi’ is from Catull. 62 (64). 406, “Omnia fanda nefanda malo permixta furore.” It is hard to say whether ‘fandum’ and ‘nefandum’ thus coupled should be taken in the supposed old sense of the gerundive, as a present participle, and so as strictly equivalent to ‘fas’ and ‘nefas,’ or understood in the ordinary way, things that may or may not be spoken. With the general sense comp. Od. 2. 66., 9. 269 foll. Virg may conceivably have thought of Catull. 28 (30). 11, “Si tu oblitus es, at di meminere, at meminit Fides.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[544] ‘Aeneas was our king,’ not ‘we had a king called Aeneas,’ which would imply that Aeneas was unknown. Heyne was the first who put a comma at ‘alter.’ The old punctuation connected ‘iustior’ with ‘pietate,’ a combination in itself very harsh, and moreover involving an unexampled inversion. For the omission of ‘neque’ in the first clause, comp. Caes. B. C. 3. 71 (quoted by Gossr.), “sed in litteris, quas scribere est solitus, neque in fascibus insignia laureae praetulit.” So in Greek, Aesch. Ag. 532, Choeph. 294. With ‘pietate maior’ comp. 11. 292, “Hic pietate prior.” Cerda comp. Il. 3. 179, ἀμφότερον βασιλεύς τ᾽ ἀγαθὸς κρατερός τ᾽ αἰχμητής. ‘Bello et armis’ pleonastic, 4. 615., 7. 235 (comp. the latter passage generally). \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[546] Lucr. 5.857, “quaecumque vides vesci vitalibus auris.” Lachm. on Lucr. 3.405 objects to the combination “aetheriae” or “aetheris aurae” or “aura,” on the ground that “aurae” belong to the “aer,” not to the “aether;” accordingly, wherever the words occur, he would alter “aetherius” into “aerius,” as here and 6. 762, or “aurae” into “orae,” as in 4. 445., 7. 557, G. 2. 292. Both changes are natural enough; “aetherius” and “aerius” are confused in the MSS. 5. 518, 520., 8. 221; in G. 2. 47 Med. has “auras” for “oras.” But whatever may be the case with Lucr. (and I am glad to see that Prof. Munro rejects his predecessor's view), there seems on the one hand no reason why Virg. may not have used “aether” loosely in this connexion, as equivalent to “caelum” (a word with which “aurae” is not unfrequently joined, 6. 363., 7. 543, 768., 11. 595), while on the other “aura” at any rate is found in Virg. in a sense in which it is peculiarly appropriate to “aether,” if not actually synonymous with it, “Aetherium sensum atque aurai simplicis ignem,” 6. 747. This is probably its sense here, as Henry suggests,—the same mixture of the notions of light and air which we find G. 2. 340, “lucem hausere.” Henry comp. Stat. Theb. 1. 237 (of the blind Oedipus), “Proiecitque diem nec iam amplius aethere nostro Vescitur,” on which Lachm. merely remarks, “Statio licuit improprie loqui.” Elsewhere Virg. connects “aether” with life, 6. 436., 11. 104. Heyne remarks that Virg. was probably thinking of such passages as Od. 20. 207 foll., εἴ που ἔτι ζώει καὶ ὁρᾷ φάος ἠελίοιο: Εἰ δ᾽ ἤδη τέθνηκε καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισιν, a supposition which may perhaps be thought to confirm the view of ‘aura aetheria’ just maintained.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[547] Crudelibus umbris, the cruel darkness of death. Heyne and Wagn. take ‘umbris’ as the dative and ‘occubare umbris’ as a synonym for “occumbere morti.” But “occumbere” means to fall, ‘occubare’ to lie dead, so that Forb. is doubtless right in making ‘umbris’ abl., unless we suppose that ‘occubat umbris’ can be i. q. “iacet inter umbras,” lies among the spectres.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[548] Nec is the reading of all the MSS., except the Hamburg corrected, and of Serv., and is supported by the occurrence of the expression “nec te paeniteat” E. 2. 34., 10. 17, where it is nearly equivalent to “nec pudeat.” ‘Ne’ was recommended by Heins. and introduced by Heyne, and has been followed by most subsequent critics. Retaining ‘nec,’ we must understand ‘non metus’ with Henry, ‘we have no cause to dread,’ which would agree with Dido's words v. 562. But the expression is a harsh one, though it may perhaps be palliated by such phrases as “haud mora.” There should, I think, be a semicolon or colon after ‘metus;’ not a period, as Ribbeck punctuates, as if a new thought began here and were carried on to the end of v. 550. It is Aeneas who will repay Dido if he lives. ‘Officio certasse priorem,’ to have taken the lead in the rivalry of good deeds. Comp. the phrase “provocare aliquem beneficio.” “Si muneribus certes” E. 2. 57. Comp. generally the parallel 7. 233, “Nec Troiam Ausonios gremio excepisse pigebit.” ‘Certasse,’ like ‘paeniteat,’ assumes that Dido has already done what Ilioneus asks her to do. See E. 2. 34, referred to above.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[549] It is difficult to determine the exact point of this sentence, as ‘et’ may mean, besides Aeneas, i. q. “we have other protectors who may receive us and repay you,” or, besides Carthage, i. q. “we have other cities where we may settle, and are not come to intrude on you,” or lastly, besides Italy, i. q. “we have another chance if our hopes there are gone.” The last would accord with the remainder of the speech, which dwells on the two courses open to them, that of fulfilling their Italian destiny should Aeneas be alive, or that of settling in Sicily should he and his heir be dead.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[550] Armaque Rom., Pal., Gud., ‘arvaque’ Med. The great majority of MSS. would seem to be in favour of the former: the latter is found in at least one of the Oxford MSS., that of Ball. Coll. In internal probability the two words seem to be as nearly balanced as possible. ‘Arva’ brings out further the notion of a settlement, and is used repeatedly in connexion with the Trojan settlement in Italy (see among many other passages v. 569 below, 4. 311, 355, and comp. 3. 136). ‘Arma’ adds a new thought, and one which is natural enough in the mouth of Ilioneus. Arms are a natural addition to a city: comp. v. 347 foll. above, “urbem Patavi sedesque locavit Teucrorum, et genti nomen dedit, armaque fixit Troia,” 12. 192 foll., “socer arma Latinus habeto . . . mihi moenia Teucri Constituent, urbique dabit Lavinia nomen.” The Trojans have arms of their own (comp. 4. 48, where observe “urbem” and “regna” in the immediate context); but in the absence of Aeneas they must seek armed assistance elsewhere. Such being the balance of probabilities, I have decided, after much hesitation, by external evidence, adopting ‘arma’ with Henry and Ribbeck, against most modern critics. ‘Arva’ was first introduced by Heyne. Oddly enough, there are traces of a similar variety in Pal. and another MS. below, v. 569, where, though ‘arma’ would be out of the question, there is a certain parallelism. ‘A sanguine,’ without a participle or word indicating origin, 5. 299.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[551] Wagn., Jahn, and Wund. seem right in taking vv. 551—558 as one sentence, “liceat subducere classem, ut Italiam petamus si datur Italiam tendere, sin absumpta salus, ut saltem Siciliam petamus.” The old method had been to break up the passage, considering ‘ut petamus’ as an elliptical expression, and the second ‘petamus’ as optative. ‘Subducere classem,’ to lay up the fleet, opposed to “deducere,” to launch. Instances are given by Forc. Ribbeck supposes the passage to be unfinished, thinking the transition from the previous sentence to the present a harsh one; but see on v. 549.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[552] Silvis aptare trabes, to fashion planks in the woods; that is, to fit them to the breaches which required mending in the ship's side. Comp. 5. 753, G. 1. 171 note. ‘Stringere remos,’ to clear branches or trees of their leaves and twigs for oars, hence called “tonsae.” Comp. G. 2. 368, “tum stringe comas, tum bracchia tonde.” Silius has imitated the expression (6. 352), “Aut silvis stringunt remos aut abiete secta Transtra novant.” Comp. also A. 4. 399, “Frondentisque ferunt remos et robora silvis Infabricata fugae studio.” ‘Silvis,’ as if he had said, ‘give us the use of your woods for repairing our ships,’ while it gives the picture of hasty work, carried on in the woods themselves, as in the passage just quoted.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[553] The repetition of ‘Italiam’ has been complained of, but it really adds force, showing what is the speaker's first object. Comp. 3. 253, “Italiam cursu petitis, ventisque vocatis Ibitis Italiam.” “Classem sociosque receptos” below v. 583.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[554] Italiam Latiumque: see v. 3. Ilioneus has not previously mentioned Latium, while he has spoken of Italy vv. 530 foll. as an unknown country; but Virg.'s love of variety leads him to neglect these minutiae. So Dido talks of “Saturnia arva” below v. 569.\n" +

The natural sense is ‘the gallant deeds and the heroes.’ ‘Tanti incendia belli:’ comp. Cic. pro Marcell. 9, “belli civilis incendium salute patriae restinguere.” The same metaphor occurs de Rep. 1. 1 and elsewhere in Cic. ‘Tanta,’ the reading before Heins., has no first-class authority. In the parallel 7. 222 foll. the siege and fall of Troy are also expressed by a metaphor, but it is from a tempest and a deluge.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[567] Obtunsa, blunted and so dull; the reverse of “curis acuens mortalia corda” G. 1. 123. ‘Pectora,’ minds, not hearts. Hor. 1 Ep. 4. 6, “Non tu corpus eras sine pectore.” ‘Gestamus pectora’ like “Is sapientia munitum pectus egregie gerat,” Attius Brutus fr. 2: see Munro on Lucr. 3.1049. Comp. φέρειν, φορεῖν. ‘Obtunsa’ is of course a predicate—‘the minds within us are not so dull.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[568] Both this and the preceding line are intended to rebut the supposition of ignorance respecting the history of Troy, not of want of feeling; so that the references of the older commentators to the recoil of the sun from the banquet of Thyestes are quite out of place. The notion seems to be ‘we do not lie so far out of the pale of the civilized world—out of the circuit of the sun, and so out of the course of fame.’ Comp. 6. 796, “iacet extra sidera tellus Extra anni Solisque vias.” It would add great force to the passage if we could suppose Virg. to have conceived of the sun as the actual bearer of news to the nations of the earth, as in the well-known passage in the dying speech of Ajax, Soph. Aj. 845—849, and in Od. 8. 270, 302, Aesch. Ag. 632—676. But it is to be observed that in these passages the sun is the only possible witness; and though such a thought may possibly have crossed the mind of Statius when imitating this passage in Theb. 1. 683 (“Scimus, ait; nec sic aversum Fama Mycenis Volvit iter”), it would be hazardous to assume this to have been Virg.'s meaning when the passage can be explained without it, and the simpler view is confirmed by the language of the parallel 7. 225—227. Silius (15. 334) has imitated these words in a way which seems to show that he understood them, like the old commentators, as having reference to the recoil of the sun at a dreadful occurrence. ‘Iungit equos’ seems to imply that the people disclaimed by Dido lie beyond the sun-rising.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[569] Hesperiam magnam (7. 4) like “Italiam magnam” 4. 345, seemingly an ornamental epithet. ‘Saturniaque arva:’ see 8. 349 foll.\n" +

				"[570] Optatis, choose, not wish.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[572] Wagn. and others, following Serv. (“deest vel si”), strike out the interrogation at the end of this line, understanding it as a hypothesis without ‘si,’ on the ground that Dido is simply giving them their choice, not pressing an invitation. They do not however attempt to prove either that the invitation conveyed by the interrogative form is a pressing one, or that an invitation would be inappropriate here. On the contrary the whole tenor of Dido's language to the end of the speech seems to show that she hopes they will settle. For the expression comp. Hor. 1 Od. 27. 9, where no one has yet proposed to change the punctuation. ‘Mecum pariter:’ ‘pariter’ has its strict sense: on equal terms with me. The order in Pal. is ‘pariter mecum.’ Some inferior MSS. have ‘consistere,’ Rom. ‘terris.’ ‘Considere’ of settling in a country 3. 162., 4 39 &c.\n" +

				"[573] Urbem quam statuo, vestra est. This attraction of the antecedent to the case of the relative has been abundantly illustrated by the commentators. The commonest and perhaps the best passage is Ter. Eun. 4. 3. 11, “Eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quas turbas dedit.” “Urbem praeclaram statui” are Dido's words 4. 655.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[574] Nullo discrimine agetur is commonly explained by reference to the Greek ἄγειν, to weigh or to regard, in which case we must suppose ‘agere’ to be a variety for “ducere.” Comp. 10. 108, “Tros Rutulusne fuat nullo discrimine habebo.” It is possible however that Virg. may have also been thinking of “discrimen agere” as equivalent to “discrimen facere” (comp. “censuram,” “delectum agere,” &c.). Serv.'s “‘agetur,’ regetur,” if intended for anything more than the most general explanation, seems quite untenable.\n" +

Either sense would be tenable here. ‘Compulsus’ may mean either driven as you were driven, in which case we might take ‘eodem’ adverbially (comp. Caes. B. G. 1. 4, “Omnis clientes suos eodem conduxit”), or driven by stress of weather (‘Noto’). Comp. generally 7. 263 foll. “Ipse modo Aeneas . . . adveniat.” ‘Atque utinam’ E. 10. 35.\n" +

				"[587] Purgat borrows ‘se’ from ‘scindit.’ ‘In aethera:’ see on 5. 20. Wakefield's preference (on Lucr. 3.507) of the variant ‘aera’ is particularly unfortunate, as it is the grosser “aer” that defecates into the purer “aether.” Καὶ τότε δή ῤ̔ αὐτοῖο πάλιν χύτο θέσφατος ἀήρ, Od. 7. 143.\n" +

Except in employing the agency of Venus, who is not only the mother of Aeneas, but the goddess of beauty, Virg. is as usual less appropriate as well as forcible than Hom.

				"[591] Adflarat, as regards ‘caesariem,’ is a zeugma; as regards ‘lumen’ it may refer to the supposed connexion between light and air, indicated by such passages as 3. 600, “hoc caeli spirabile lumen” (see above on v. 546). ‘Purpureum,’ glowing. For the vague use of ‘purpureus’ see on E. 5. 38. The word here probably refers to the rosy bloom of youth. ‘Honores,’ lustre. ‘Laetus’ is φαιδρός. Virg. may have thought of Eur. Bacch. 236, οἰνωπός, ὄσσοις χάριτας Ἀφροδίτης ἔχων.\n" +

				"[592] Hom. has simply ὡς δ᾽ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ Ἴδρις, which answers to ὡς ἄρα τῷ κατέχευε (Ἀθήνη) χάριν, the point being that the beauty of Ulysses is, as it were, gilded with diviner grace, as silver is gilded with more precious gold. Virg. has taken the idea of beauty superadded by art, and expressed it in two ways, neither of them exactly the same as Homer's. The first (‘quale manus addunt ebori decus’) is the mere superaddition of art to a beautiful material (‘manus,’ in the technical sense of the artist's hand, v. 455 above); the second, the adornment of silver or marble with gold, a practice similar to that referred to 10. 135, and illustrated in Heyne's Excursus. ‘Flavo:’ elsewhere gold is called “fulvum,” 7. 279, &c.\n" +

After much hesitation I have allowed the parallel “tot casibus actos,” above v. 240, to decide me to follow the rest of the editors.

Vat. and Gud., besides Serv., and is rightly preferred by all modern editors. There is still a question whether ‘mens sibi conscia recti’ is to be coupled with ‘Di’ or with ‘iustitia.’ Those who read ‘iustitiae’ of course adopted the former view; but it is supported also by Serv., though reading ‘iustitia,’ with the remark that the doctrine that virtue is its own reward is Stoic, and in modern times by Peerlkamp, and undoubtedly receives strong confirmation from 9. 252 foll., which is generally parallel, “Quae vobis, quae digna, viri, pro laudibus istis Praemia posse rear solvi? pulcherrima primum Di moresque dabunt vestri.” On the whole however the latter view is that to which the passage itself seems most naturally to point. ‘If justice and conscious rectitude be of any account anywhere on earth.’ Comp. 2. 142, “si qua est, quae restat adhuc mortalibus usquam Intemerata fides.” “Mens sibi conscia facti” is read by some Lucr. 3.1018, where Lachm. retains “factis,” joining “sibi” with “praemetuens.”\n" +

				"[607] Dum montibus umbrae lustrabunt convexa, while the shadows move in the hollows of the hills. ‘Umbrae,’ not, as Heyne thinks, the shadows of the woods, but those cast by the hills themselves, E. 1. 84. ‘Lustrabunt’ Heyne explains rightly of the shadow moving with the sun. With ‘convexa’ comp. “convexo nemorum,” v. 310, and the word “convallis.” Many critics, from the time of Serv., have taken ‘convexa’ with ‘sidera’ (comparing Ov. 4. ex Pont. 9. 129), supposing ‘lustrabunt’ to be corrupt (‘lustra dabunt,’ Heins., ‘constabunt,’ Burm.; Ribbeck thinks the passage imperfect). The use of a word in one sense in a context which would seem to suggest another, is not unVirgilian, even where, as here, that other sense is not meant to be in any way recognized. ‘Polus dum sidera pascet’ is from Lucr. 1.231, “unde aether sidera pascit” (comp. Id. 5. 523 foll.). Virg. also had v. 230 (“Unde mare ingenui fontes externaque longe Flumina suppeditant”) in his eye, though the prominent thought with him is not the constant supply, but simply the constant course of nature. perhaps, as the earlier critics suggested, Virg. may also have thought of Callim. Del. 176, “τείρεσιν, ἡνίκα πλεῖστα κατ᾽ ἠέρα βουκολέονται”, the stars being conceived of as a flock grazing in the sky. Med. and one or two others have ‘pascit:’ see on 4. 336.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[609] This line is repeated from E. 5. 78. The sense of that passage is, so long as rural life exists, you shall be celebrated with festivals like the gods. So here we may explain, with Wagn., ‘so long as nature holds her course, your name shall be perpetuated in the land where I may be, be it Italy or any other.’ Comp. 5. 49—60, where a similar promise is made to the memory of Anchises, and 4. 335, where the same acknowledgment is made more weakly to Dido herself. This seems more likely than Henry's view, ‘whatever becomes of me, your fame is assured.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[610] Vocant expresses that he is dependent on destiny, and so implies that he will have to leave Dido, as Henry remarks. Comp. 3. 494, “nos alia ex aliis in fata vocamur,” 5. 656, “fatisque vocantia regna.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[611] Petit dextra, puts forth his right hand to: comp. “cornu petere.” ‘Serestus,’ apparently not the same as “Sergestus” v. 510: see on 4. 288., 5. 487. The present passage, combined with v. 510, would be rather in favour of the identification, which might be compared with the double quantity of words like “Sychaeus,” though Heyne says of it “quod vix feram ne in malo quidem poeta.” \n" +

				"[614] Casu tanto, at the stupendous disaster. It would be harsh to separate ‘primo,’ as an adverb, from ‘aspectu’ (see however 4. 176); as an adjective, it may still be taken adverbially, as in 4. 166, E. 6. 1.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[615] Quis casus, τίς τύχη, “quae fortuna” (comp. above v. 240). ‘Quae vis,’ τίς βία. The meaning seems to be, “How inveterate the ill-fortune that persecutes you! how savage the violence that leads you here!” the question being one of wonder. In v. 9 he is driven through ‘casus:’ here the ‘casus’ drives him.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[616] Inmanibus, savage, with reference to the Libyans, an apology for the roughness of her own people being blended with an identification of his misfortunes with her own. “Terrae adplicat ipsum,” 12. 303. Here it = “adpellere,” v. 377 above.\n" +

				"[619] Teucer, being refused admission in Salamis by his father on his return from Troy, founded a new Salamis in Cyprus. Virg. supposes him to have sought the assistance of Belus, king of Tyre, whom he represents to have conquered the Cyprians shortly before. See Heyne's Excursus.\n" +

In this use of the word the notion is generally that of a vain pretension or fancy: but Cic. 1 De Or. 4. § 13, “Gracciam, quae semper eloquentiae princeps esse voluit,” approaches nearly to the meaning here. Virg. evidently meant to express the Homeric εὔχεται εἶναι. ‘Ab’ was restored by Heins. from Med. and others for ‘a,’ which does not seem to be found in any first-class MS.\n" +

				"[631] Simul—simul, like ἅμα—ἅμα. Here, as in 2. 220, they couple two verbs with the same subject: in v. 513., 5. 675, two subjects with the same verb.\n" +

Ag. 87 foll., 594 foll., compared with vv. 1056 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[634, 5] Taken, but, as usual, with an exaggeration, significant of unreality, from Od. 8. 59 foll. Comp. 5. 96 note. ‘Magnorum horrentia centum Terga suum,’ for “centum sues tergis horrentibus.” Comp. 4. 511 note. ‘Centum’ may go either with ‘terga’ or with ‘suum;’ but it more probably belongs to the former. See on 5. 404, “tantorum ingentia septem Terga boum.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[636] Dei is the reading of almost all the existing MSS., including Rom. and Med., which has the final ‘i’ added in red ink. Gellius, 9. 14, asserts that ‘dii’ for ‘diei’ is the true reading, the other having been introduced by ignorant correctors. ‘Dii’ seems to be the reading of Pal. and at least one other MS., from Ribbeck's silence. It is obvious that Gell.'s is merely a critical opinion, and proves nothing as to the superior antiquity of either reading. All that we know is that both readings existed from an early time, and that while ‘dii’ was supported by several authorities after Gellius, such as Julius Romanus, ‘dei’ was maintained by others, such as Rufius Apronianus and Donatus, whose explanation is “vinum quod sufficeret omnibus.” Serv. mentions both readings, and a third, ‘die’ (see on G. 1. 208), which is found in one copy. Two others appear to have ‘diei.’ ‘Munera laetitiamque dei’ evidently refers to wine, which would naturally form a part of Dido's presents; the expression being resolvable into “munera laetifica dei laetitiae datoris” (comp. v. 734, “Adsit laetitiae Bacchus dator”). Bacchus, as henry remarks, is called simply ‘deus’ 9. 337, “multoque iacebat Membra deo victus,” according to one interpretation of the words. On the other hand, it would be difficult to affix any precise sense to the line if ‘dii’ were read. Heyne's explanation is “pecudes quae pro munere sint, et quarum epulis dies hilariter agatur.” ‘Dii’ has been adopted however by most of the later editors. If any awkwardness is felt from the asyndeton, we may impute it to the imperfect state of the passage.\n" +

				"[637] Imitated from Catull. 62 (64). 43—51. Comp. especially v. 46, “Tota domus gaudet regali splendida gaza.” The words ‘regali splendida luxu instruitur’ are to be connected closely together, ‘is being set out in the splendour of royal magnificence’ (“instruitur ut splendida sit” Serv.), ‘luxu’ being probably connected with ‘splendida’ like “gaza” in Catull. l. c. ‘At domus interior’ recurs 2. 486, also of the “atrium.” Comp. the banquet in 3. 353 foll. note. Cic. has “instructa et exornata domus” 2 Verr. 2. 34, “omnibus rebus instructum et paratum convivium” ib. 4. 27. \n" +

				"[638] Mediis tectis is explained by ‘domus interior.’\n" +

				"[639] Arte laboratae is the predicate. ‘The coverlets were embroidered and of princely purple: on the table was spread massy silver plate, and vessels of gold chased with legends.’ ‘Vestes’ for “stragulae vestes,” as in Lucr. 2.36 &c. ‘Ostro superbo,’ abl. of the material.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[640] “Ingens argentum” 3. 466, as we speak of plate as ‘silver.’ ‘Ingens’ probably includes both massiveness and quantity. The gold seems to be plate also, cups, &c.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[642] Antiqua Rom., Pal., and Gud. originally, ‘antiquae’ Med., Pal., and Gud. corrected. The former, which was restored by Heyne but ejected by Wagn., seems slightly preferable, both on the ground of authority and as avoiding a harsh elision.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[646] No strictly parallel instance has been adduced of this use of ‘stat,’ which seems to imply concentration, halting as it were and making a stand. Comp. “consistere in aliquo.” See on 2. 163, which is not parallel.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[648] Pallam. It is difficult to extract a consistent view from the two articles “Pallium” and “Tunica” in the Dict. Ant., the former of which makes “palla” a poetical synonym for “pallium,” the outer garment worn by both sexes, while the latter makes “palla” as characteristic of women as “toga” of men. The common opinion (comp. Forc. “Palla” and Forb. on this verse) seems to be that “palla” was a long garment (probably a pall without sleeves) worn by women and by persons of dignity, especially by the gods. For ‘signis auroque rigentem’ (which is probably a hendiadys) comp. Lucr. 5.1427, “veste Purpurea atque auro signisque ingentibus apta,” where “rigentibus” has been plausibly conjectured.\n" +

				"[649] ‘A veil with a border of yellow acanthus.’ Serv., on 7. 188, mentions the veil of Ilione as one of the seven national heirlooms which preserved the Roman empire. The ‘acanthus’ seems to have been specially appropriated to borders of this kind, so that Hesychius actually defines the word περίραμμα ὑφασμένον. ‘Circumtextum’ seems to have been used as a subst., equivalent to the Greek κύκλας, by which Serv. renders it here: comp. Varro L. L. 5. 132, Isidor. 19. 24. 10, cited by Lersch, A. V. § 79. The more ordinary colour of the ‘acanthus’ was white, but later poets (Calp. 4. 68, Stat. 3 Silv. 1. 37, quoted by Heyne) speak of it as red or purple. \n" +

F. 6. 38, and Hecuba speaks of herself as supported by Priam's sceptre Eur. Tro. 150, but no instance has been adduced where it is carried by a woman who is not even a queen, but only a princess royal.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[654] Collo for the neck, a construction generally found where there is a verb or verbal notion, as in 10. 135, “Aut collo decus aut capiti.” Such a notion we may borrow here if we please from “munera ferre” above v. 647. So perhaps 7. 350, “fit tortile collo Aurum ingens coluber,” though there a local abl. is at least equally possible. For ‘monile bacatum’ see Dict. A. “monile.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[655] Duplicem gemmis auroque coronam: probably a double circlet of gold and gems, whether formed by one circlet of each is difficult to say. The commentators evidently are at a loss, as their explanations are mere conjecture; some suggesting that ‘duplex’ refers to the combination of gems and gold, while others think that the double crown means a bridal crown as distinguished from the crown worn by virgins, which may have been single.\n" +

R. 3. 112 foll., where Aphrodite, at the instance of Here and Athene, prevails on Love to inflame Medea with a passion for Jason: but there is no similarity in the details. ‘Novas artis’ carries the reader back to v. 417. Virg. however may have intended to represent the Homeric ἔνθ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε, which he has translated 12. 843.\n" +

				"[659] Dulci carries us back to his father's feelings v. 646, and forward to his probable attractions for the queen. ‘Donisque furentem incendat reginam,’ inflame the queen to madness by his gifts. Comp. v. 714, “pariter puero donisque movetur.” There is possibly an allusion to the scene in the Medea of Euripides, where Medea's children carry to Creusa a crown and a robe which actually consume her. The parallel may serve as an answer to Schrader's wonder, mentioned by Heyne, that a wealthy queen like Dido should be captivated with presents.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[660] Ossibus inplicet ignem. Comp. Cic. Div. 1. 36, “Di vim suam naturis hominum inplicant.” ‘Ossa’ is put for the seat of feeling, like “medullae.” Comp. G. 3. 258.\n" +

				"[661] Domum ambiguam is to be explained by “Iunonia hospitia” v. 671; and so 4. 96, “veritam te moenia nostra, Suspectas habuisse domos Karthaginis altae.” ‘Tyrios bilinguis’ is of course an anticipation of the Roman feeling against Carthage. ‘Bilinguis’ occurs as a reproach more than once in Plautus (see Freund), where it represents the forked tongue of a serpent, and has apparently no connexion with the notion of speaking two languages.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[662] There is no occasion to separate this line from what precedes with Wagn. and Forb., as vv. 670, 671 prove. “Daphnis me malus urit” E. 8. 83, where the anxiety is that of love.—‘Sub noctem’ may be explained by observing that the action has arrived at evening. Having set her son on the way to Carthage, Venus is not at rest. She is alarmed at the warmth of his reception, and knowing that Ascanius has been sent for to the banquet, at the last moment she proposes to substitute Cupid for him. But there seems also a reference to the common thought that night aggravates rather than soothes anxiety, for which Henry comp. 4. 522 foll. ‘Cura recursat,’ 12. 802.\n" +

				"[664] “Qui solus es meae vires, mea magna potentia.” The punctuation of Med., followed by many editors, which connects ‘solus’ with what follows, is harsh and opposed by similar expressions, such as 8. 574, “care puer, mea sola et sera voluptas.” Catull. 62 (64). 215, “Nate mihi longa iucundior unice vita.” Comp. 10. 507, “O dolor atque decus magnum rediture parenti.” With the nom. ‘solus’ Forb. comp. Ov. Her. 14. 73, “Surge, age, Belide, de tot modo fratribus unus,” remarking that it is a question among grammarians whether ‘solus’ has a vocative. The line is imitated by Ov.

				"[665] For Typhoeus or Typhon struck by lightning comp. Aesch. Prom. 358 foll. The bolts are called from the giant they slew, as Serv. remarks, like Roman generals from the nations they conquered. A more far-fetched explanation is that of Pomponius Sabinus, who makes ‘Typhoia’ = “Aetnaea,” Aetna being called ‘Typhois’ Ov. Her. 15. 11, as resting, according to one story, on Typhoeus. The orthography ‘Typhoia,’ like “Cyclopia” (v. 201), is adopted by Heyne for the sake of the metre, contrary to all the extant MSS., which have ‘Typhoea.’ Serv. however says that many in his time had ‘Typhoia.’ The device of Cupid breaking or trampling on the thunderbolt is common in gems.\n" +

				"[666] Tua numina, the acc. of the person of whom the request is made, not of the thing requested. Comp. 8. 382, “Ergo eadem supplex venio et sanctum mihi numen Arma rogo,” 3. 543 “numina sancta precamur Palladis.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[667] Serv., in commenting on the adroitness of the whole address, notices ‘frater tuus,’ “ostendit ei etiam profuturum qui rogatur.” ‘Omnia circum litora:’ elsewhere Aeneas is said to wander over all lands (v. 756., 5. 627 &c.); here for the sake of variety he is said to wander about them, tossed from one to another and resting on none. So ‘litora’ is used rather than ‘terras.’ Comp. 3. 75, “oras et litora circum errantem,” of Delos. See on v. 32 above. ‘Pelago,’ on or over the sea, not the instr. abl. Comp. v. 3.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[668] Iactetur fragm. Vat. originally, Pal., ‘iacteturque’ Med., Rom., Gud., and most MSS., including fragm. Vat. corrected, and Serv., who says “vacat que.” It seems hopeless to explain ‘iacteturque,’ as Wagn. inclines to do (Q. V. 12. 13), either by making ‘que’ couple ‘pelago’ with ‘omnia litora,’ or by supposing a corruption in ‘pelago’ or ‘circum;’ or again, as might be just possible, by supposing ‘pelago’ to be coupled with ‘odiis’ (comp. 2. 179, where two dissimilar ablatives are joined by ‘et’); while the insertion of ‘que’ is sufficiently accounted for by an anxiety to mend the metre. With the lengthening of the final syll. here Weidner comp. 4. 222., 5. 284, G. 3. 76, in all which places there is a kind of pause after the word, so that here probably we should take ‘odiis’ in a loose connexion with ‘iactetur’ as an abl. of circumstance, rather than as an instr. abl. Comp. 8. 292, quoted just below. ‘Acerbae’ fragm. Vat., Pal., Gud., all originally, ‘iniquae’ Med., Rom., and apparently the great bulk of MSS. Internal evidence is strongly for ‘acerbae,’ as its insertion cannot easily be explained, while ‘iniquae’ doubtless came from a recollection of 8. 292, “fatis Iunonis iniquae,” where there seems to be no various reading. It is curious that in 11. 587, “fatis urguetur acerbis,” some inferior MSS. give “iniquis,” apparently from a recollection of 2. 257.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[669] Nota, for ‘notum;’ a Grecism: see Il. 16. 128 &c. Comp. 11. 310, “Cetera qua rerum iaceant perculsa ruina, Ante oculos interque manus sunt omnia vestras,” Pliny, Paneg. 44 (quoted by Wund.), “An prona parvaque sunt ad aemulandum, quod nemo incolumitatem turpitudine rependit?” ‘Et nostro doluisti saepe dolore,’ apparently a phrase for sympathy, with which Forb. comp. Plaut. Pers. 5. 1 ult., “Bene ei, qui hoc gaudio gaudet.” ‘Dolore’ however may be merely an abl. of the occasion, ‘thou hast grieved at my grief.’ Serv. gives both interpretations.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[670] Nunc, Pal., fragm. Vat. originally, and some others. ‘Hunc’ Med., Rom., Gud., &c., which Wagn. ingeniously explains as = “eum nunc.” On the whole I have preferred ‘nunc,’ with Wakef. and Ribbeck, as the repetition of ‘hunc’ v. 680 would be rather formal. The line is imitated from Od. 1. 55 foll., as Weidner remarks.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[671] Quo se vertant, what may be their issue. “Quo sese vertant tantae sortes somnium,” Enn. Alex. fr. 1. “Quod se bene vertat,” for the more usual “quod bene vertat,” is found Enn. A. 1. fr. 69. Here the word may suggest a notion of change, like “ne quo se numine mutet,” v. 674. “Aeneia hospitia,” 10. 494, in a different sense.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[672] The nom. to ‘cessabit’ is “Iuno,” contained in ‘Iunonia.’ Comp. Livy 2. 53, “Veiens bellum exortum, quibus (Veientibus) Sabini arma coniunxerant” (quoted by Forb.). Serv. says that there is a proverb “res est in cardine, hoc est, in articulo.” A similar use of ‘cardo’ is found in imitators of Virg., as Statius and Val. Flaccus, and twice in Quinctilian: see Forc. Here it may conceivably have been chosen with reference to ‘vertant,’ which would agree with Serv.'s explanation, “a ianua, quae motu cardinis hac atque illac inpelli potest.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[673] Capere ante dolis et cingere flamma. Both terms are taken from strategy, though they are clearly not meant to be harmonized. The sense is, I mean to make a complete conquest of her, so as to preclude all other intervention. With ‘cingere flamma,’ comp. 10. 119, “moenia cingere flammis.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[674] Ne quo se numine mutet, that Dido's friendly feelings may not be changed by Juno. ‘Quo numine’ may either be rendered generally, by any power but mine, or by Juno's power in any way, like “quo numine laeso,” v. 8. The abl. however is rather that of circumstance than of the instrument.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[675] Mecum: “pariter atque ego” is the common interpretation, adopted by Heyne, Wagn., and Forb. Comp. G. 1. 41, “Ignarosque viae mecum miseratus agrestis.” According to this interpretation Venus would wish that Dido's affection should not be hollow (“quippe domum timet ambiguam Tyriosque bilinguis”), but as sincere as her own. It might also be proposed to connect ‘mecum’ closely with ‘teneatur,’ kept on my side, or, in my power, which would accord with the general metaphor of the previous lines. Comp. 4. 115, “Mecum erit iste labor.” ‘Teneri amore’ is a common expression; and if the latter interpretation be adopted, Virg. has blended this with other notions, perhaps that of a town invested (“obsidione teneri,” 10. 109). Serv, who objects to the common view, on the ground that Dido could not love Aeneas like a mother, has “per meos amores, me adnitente,” which would not be so natural.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[676] For ‘qua,’ ‘quam’ is read by Gud., ‘quo’ by some other MSS. ‘Accipere,’ of hearing, 2. 65, like “dare,” of telling, E. 1. 18. “Haec tibi mens est,” 8. 400, though there the notion is rather of purpose than of opinion.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[677] “Regius puer,” 5. 252, of Ganymede. ‘Accitu genitoris,’ like “dei iussu,” 2. 247.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[678] Mea maxuma cura: so Ascanius 10. 132 is called “Veneris iustissima cura,” as also “Dardanius puer.” Wagn. not unnaturally complains of the words as otiose here, the plot not being intended to benefit Ascanius in any way, except so far as he is served by anything which serves Aeneas. It is possible however that the removal of Ascanius to Idalia may be meant to present itself to Venus as a natural outlet for her own affection, as well as in pursuance of the plot: comp. 10. 46—53, where the general thought is parallel. The very obscurity with which this is indicated may be an intentional stroke, in a speech from which everything is excluded which does not bear on the one object of persuading Cupid. But on such matters it is easy to be over-subtle.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[679] Pelago et flammis is probably the dat. (‘restare’ being construed like ‘superesse’), not the abl., as Forb. thinks.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[680] Sopitum somno. A similar pleonasm occurs in Lucr. 4.453, “cum suavi devinxit membra sopore Somnus, et in summa corpus iacet omne quiete” (quoted by Forb.). ‘Super alta Cythera:’ Venus, like other gods, had her temples in high places. Cythera is called high here, and in 10. 86. “Alti Idaliae luci” are mentioned just below, v. 692, and “celsa Paphos,” 10. 51. Comp. also “sublimis abit,” v. 415. Wagn. appears right in remarking that “super” is frequently used for entering a high place, as “sub” for entering a low place, and “per” for entering a large place.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[681] Sacrata sede, in my temple or grove. “Cereris sedem sacratam,” 2. 742. As might be expected, two MSS. have “secreta.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[682] Ne qua scire dolos. There is something inartificial in the arrangement here, as Cupid has not yet been told that he is to personate Ascanius, and the only way in which Ascanius could spoil the plot would be by appearing along with Cupid. Venus however has had the details in her mind from the first, v. 658, and she naturally dismisses the subject of Ascanius first, so as to conclude her speech with instructions to Cupid. Henry distinguishes between knowledge of the plot (‘scire dolos’） and accidental intervention (‘medius occurrere’). “Medius intercipit,” 10. 402.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[683] “Digitum non altior unum,” Lucr. 4.414. See Madv. § 306. ‘Noctem non amplius unam’ is to be explained like “plus septuma ducitur aestas” G. 4. 207 (note), the case, which here is the acc. of duration, not being altered by the construction with the comparative, any more than if “quam” had been used. See Madv. § § 305, 306.\n" +

				"[684] Falle dolo, personate. Gossrau comp. μορφὴν δολώσας, Soph. Phil. 129, where however δολοῦν merely means to disguise. Comp. rather the use of ‘mentior,’ and see note on v. 407. ‘Notos pueri puer indue voltus:’ it will not be difficult for you to put on the expression of a boy as you are a boy yourself. Venus removes an objection by anticipation. The notions of actual transformation and of imitation are blended and perhaps confused throughout. ‘Notos,’ not known to Cupid, but i. q. “solitos:” “non corpore notae Sufficiunt vires,” 12. 911. ‘Pueri puer:’ comp. 5. 569.\n" +

				"[690] Gressu gaudens incedit Iuli refers to his change of nature from a winged god to a boy, not to his change of gait from that of a god (vv. 46, 405., 5. 649) to that of Iulus. ‘Gaudens,’ like “laetus” in v. 696, expresses the sly pleasure with which he enters into his part.\n" +

				"[692] Lucr. 4.907, “somnus per membra quietem Inriget.” Furius Antias ap. Macrob. Sat. 6. 1, “mitemque rigat per pectora somnum.” The expression seems to be a translation of the Homeric ἐπὶ γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἔχευεν, περὶ δ᾽ ἀμβρόσιος κέχυθ᾽ ὕπνος, but the notions expressed by the two are in all probability quite different; the Homeric image being apparently that of sleep enveloping a man (the reader of Don Quixote will recall Sancho Panza's “Blessings on the man that invented sleep! it folds round a man like a cloak”), while in ‘inrigat’ the conception would seem to be of dew or rain coming down. Comp. the image in 5. 854, where Sleep shakes a bough dripping with the dews of Lethe over the temples of Palinurus, and its imitation in Val. Fl. 4. 15. Whether the dews are the dews of night or of the body in sleep, is not clear. Pers. 5. 56 would prove the latter, if he does not mean satirically to pervert the image.\n" +

				"[696] If ‘laetus’ is to be connected with ‘duce,’ it means that he shows signs of pleasure as he goes along.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[697] Cum venit. On his arrival the feast begins. ‘Conposuit—locavit:’ the perfect coupled with the historic present ‘venit,’ as the pluperfect would have been coupled with the past. ‘Aulaea’ are doubtless the awning or curtain that hung from a Roman ceiling to catch the dust, and under which the couches would be arranged. Comp. Hor. 2 S. 8. 54, and the Schol. there. So also Serv. and the older commentators interpreted it, and so Henry. It is difficult however to account for the abl., which may be either in or under a curtain, or settled herself (‘conposuit se’） with a curtain, as contributing to the ease of the banquet. Heyne, followed by the later editors, takes ‘aulaea’ for the tapestry on the couch; but there seems to be no authority for this use of the term. Horace's “cenae sine aulaeis et ostro” (3 Od. 29. 15) might support such a meaning if established, but cannot be quoted to prove it.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[698] Aurea, dissyllable, 7. 190. Serv. thought it might be nom. ‘Sponda,’ the open side of the bed or couch. Dict. A. ‘lectus.’ ‘Mediam,’ in the centre of the triclinium. This seems to have been the host's place (Hor. 2 S. 8. 23). Gossrau thinks the meaning is, that Dido occupied a couch by herself in the middle of the banqueting-hall. The narrative seems to afford little or no help in determining the question: see however on v. 718. An imitation in Val. F. 2. 346 is perhaps in favour of Gossrau's view, as both Hypsipyle and Jason are represented as taking the middle place; but the passage is too rapid and summary to throw much light on Virg.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[699] Iam does not begin a new paragraph, as the early editors thought; but there is no occasion to connect this line, as Wagn. and Forb. have done, with the lines before, as though it were intended to mark still farther the time of the arrival of Ascanius.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[700] Super may be taken either as a preposition (comp. “fronde super viridi,” E. 1. 81) or adverbially—on purple spread over the couch, a view supported by v. 708, and Stat. Ach. 2. 82, “picto discumbitur ostro.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[701] Dant manibus famuli lymphas. This is the order of the words in Med., Rom., Pal., the St. Gall palimpsest, Gud., and other good MSS. The common reading, supported by the MSS. of Priscian (De fig. num. ed. Kr. 2. 389), is “dant famuli manibus lymphas.” Med., Pal., and Gud. have ‘famulae,’ which seems to have been introduced from v. 703. For the details comp. Od. 1. 144 foll. &c., and see G. 4. 376 foll. notes. ‘Cererem canistris expediunt,’ serve out the bread promptly from the baskets, “proferunt,” says Serv. In Hom. heralds serve the water, maids the bread, boys the wine.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[702] Tonsis mantelia villis: see on G. 4. 377. Here Med. a m. p. and Gud. originally have the spelling ‘mantilia.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[703, 704] All the MSS. appear to give “ordine longo,” which is the common reading. But ‘longam’ has the authority of Charisius, the oldest extant grammarian, and was current as well as ‘longo’ in the time of Gellius (4. 1). It also seems to have been read by Ausonius, who (Idyll. 3. 27) has “Conduntur fructus geminum mihi semper in annum. Cui non longa penus, huic quoque prompta fames.” This passage of Ausonius seems also to give the explanation of ‘longam’—a store that will last for a long time. Serv., in explaining the difference between ‘penus’ and “cellarium,” says that “cellarium” is “paucorum dierum, penus temporis longi,” which probably shows that he read ‘lougam’ here, especially as he goes on to speak of the gender of ‘penus.’ ‘Struere’ will then have nothing to do with the office of “structor,” the arranger of the dishes, as Taubmann supposes, but will be i. q. “instruere,” to furnish or replenish; these ‘famulae’ being evidently distinguished from the two hundred who serve the banquet. ‘Intus’ may be a translation of Hom.'s κατὰ δῶμα in the parallel passage, Od. 7. 104; but it more probably has reference to the “cella penaria,” as opposed to the hall in which the guests were served. ‘Ordine’ refers not to ‘struere,’ but to the division or course of labour among the servants, as in G. 4. 376, A. 5. 102. ‘Longo’ was retained by Heinsius and Heyne, and is still preferred by Gossrau and Henry; but ‘longam’ was restored by Wagn., and is generally read by the later editors. ‘Ordine longo’ is of course common enough in Virg.; but this would be the very reason for its introduction here by a transcriber. ‘Flammis adolere Penatis’ seems to express merely the keeping up of the fire for cooking. Comp. κτησίου βωμοῦ, Aesch. Ag. 1038, ἑστίας μεσομφάλου, ib. 1056. For ‘adolere’ see note on E. 8. 65, and comp. G. 4. 379. ‘Penatis’ seems to be etymologically connected with ‘penus,’ and therefore the two are appropriately joined. For the construction ‘cura struere’ see on G. 1. 213. \n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[705] Henry remarks, “It is neither indifferently nor accidentally that Virg. assigns to Dido a number of attendants all of one age. It appears from the following passage of Tac. A. 15. 69, that etiquette did not permit persons of private rank to be waited on by such attendants: ‘iubetque praevenire conatus consulis: occupare velut arcem eius: opprimere delectam iuventutem: quia Vestinus inminentis foro aedes decoraque servitia et pari aetate habebat.’”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[706] Most of the MSS., including Med., Gud., and partially Pal., have ‘onerent’ and ‘ponant,’ which Wagn. rightly recalled as agreeing better with ‘quibus cura’ before. Heyne had introduced ‘onerant’ and ‘ponunt’ from Rom.: it is found too in the St. Gall palimpsest. Virg. follows Hom. in setting on the cups at once. The Romans were apt to reserve drinking to the second course, as Serv. remarks on v. 723 below.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[708] Convenere iussi does not equal “convenere et iussi sunt,” as Wagn. thinks. ‘Toris iussi discumbere pictis’ is merely a poetical phrase for, bidden to the banquet. ‘Limina’ for “tecta.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[710] Flagrantis expressive of the glowing looks of lovers, and therefore appropriate to the god of love. Catull. 62 (64). 91, “flagrantia declinavit Lumina.”\n" +

				"[716] ‘Satisfied the love of his pretended father.’ For ‘falsi’ see note on v. 684, and comp. 3. 302, “falsi Simoentis ad undam.” Serv.'s explanation, “qui fallebatur, quem decipiebat,” is improbable.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[717] Haeret oculis, &c., hangs on him with her eyes and with her whole heart. Val. Fl. 6. 658, imitates the construction: “Persequitur lustrans, oculisque ardentibus haeret.” There is something of the same image in Tennyson's “And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[718] Gremio fovet: he was probably reclining next her at table. This explains ‘interdum.’ Henry rightly remarks on the force of ‘Dido’ after ‘haec,’ as tending to concentrate our thoughts on her.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[719] Insidat, Med., Gud. corrected, supported also by the MSS. of Non. 311. 29; ‘insideat,’ Rom., St. Gall palimps. Gud. originally has ‘insidiat,’ which probably points the same way. The word is lost in Pal. Serv. recognizes both readings, and on 6. 708 quotes “insidat.” On the whole it seems best, with Heyne and Ribbeck, to adopt the rarer word. The difference is between resting on the bosom and settling or sinking down into it.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[720] The only account of the epithet ‘Acidaliae’ is given by Serv., who after narrating an absurd etymology from ἄκιδες, cares, explains the word from the Acidalian spring near Orchomenus in Boeotia, where the Graces, Venus' attendants, bathed. The one other author who has used the word is Martial, who speaks, 6. 13. 5, of Venus' zone as “nodus Acidalius,” and 9. 14. 3, of “Acidalia arundo,” as a pen with which Venus would write, apparently a reed growing by the spring.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[721] Serv. (who is followed by Wund.) explains ‘praevertere,’ “praeoccupare, propter Iunonem.” Comp. “capere ante dolis,” v. 673. But the meaning more probably is, to surprise her unguarded heart—her long devotion to the dead having made her cease to regard love as anything but a thing of the past. So ‘vivo amore’ is love for a living object, and consequently itself living and real.\n" +

				"\n" + 
				"[723] Postquam prima quies epulis, when they first paused from the feast. Comp. Livy 21. 5. 9, “Cum prima quies silentiumque ab hostibus fuit” (quoted by Wagn.). ‘Postquam prima’ is equivalent to “cum primum.” There may be a notion of the actual noise of the banquet, which is succeeded by a pause, and then by the sound of conversation (“fit strepitus tectis,” &c.). ‘Mensae remotae:’ see on v. 216 above. The cups came in with the “mensae secundae” at a Roman meal. Comp. G. 2. 101; Hor. 4 Od. 5. 31. For ‘remotae’ Pal. originally has “repostae.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[724] Statuunt, as Henry remarks, is appropriate to the size of the bowls. A man could hide himself behind a crater, 9. 346. Comp. Il. 6. 526, κρητῆρα στήσασθαι ἐλεύθερον ἐν μεγάροισιν. For ‘vina coronant’ see note on G. 2. 528. The line is repeated 7. 147, with the change of “laeti” for ‘magnos.’\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[725] For ‘fit’ some inferior MSS. have ‘it,’ which is supported by several passages in Virg., especially 4. 665, “it clamor ad alta Atria,” 5. 451, “It clamor caelo,” acknowledged by Serv., and adopted by Ribbeck. ‘Tectis’ then would = “ad tecta.” ‘Fit strepitus’ however is paralleled by “fit sonitus” 2. 209, “fit gemitus” 6. 220, and agrees exactly with “facta silentia tectis” just below, v. 730. This would seem to show that the noise begins after the pause made by clearing away the food, as suggested on v. 723. Thus ‘tectis’ will have the sense ‘in the hall.’ The Longobardic MS. and a few others read ‘alta’ here for ‘ampla,’ probably from 4. 665. ‘Vocem volutant’ of the talkers, as “volutant murmura” of the winds 10. 98. “Vocem volutant” is said 5. 149 of the shores that echo the sound, a sense which some have wished to impart here, making ‘perampla’ one word.

				"[730] Soliti, sc. ‘inplere mero.’ Comp. 9. 300, “Per caput hoc iuro per quod pater ante solebat.” It is doubtful whether ‘a Belo’ means descended from Belus, or from the time of Belus; but analogy seems rather in favour of the latter. Belus here is not Dido's father (v. 621), but the supposed founder of the Tyrian dynasty. “Tum facta silentia linguis” 11. 241. The silence is natural enough when the queen is going to speak (comp. Alcinous' address to the herald Od. 7. 178). Serv. however has a note which seems to show that it was a regular custom at a certain period of the banquet, though I do not profess to understand all his words: “Mos erat apud veteres ut lumini incenso (?) silentium praeberetur, ut optativam sibi laudem loquendo nullus averteret. Apud Romanos etiam, cena edita (?) sublatisque mensis primis silentium fieri solebat, quoad ea quae de cena libata fuerant ad focum ferrentur et igni darentur, ac puer Deos propitios nuntiasset, ut Diis honor haberetur tacendo: quae res cum intercessit inter cenandum, Graeci quoque θεῶν παρουσίαν dicunt.” In the imitation by Val. F. 2. 347, silence is mentioned: “Sacris dum vincitur extis Prima fames, circum pateris it Bacchus, et omnis Aula silet: dapibus coeptis mox tempora fallunt Noctis, et in seras durant sermonibus umbras:”but though his conception of the banquet seems not quite the same as Virg.'s, he has appropriated so much of his master's language that he can hardly be cited as an independent witness.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[731] Since thou art reputed the author of the laws of hospitality. For the incident comp. Od. 7. 179 foll. and 13. 50 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[732] Laetum includes good fortune as well as mere festivity. Comp. “laetum augurium,” “prodigium,” &c. ‘Tyriis Troiaque profectis’ 4. 111. With the wish in the next line contrast the imprecation 4. 622 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[734] Hesiod, Works 614, Δῶρα Διωνύσου πολυγηθέος. ‘Bona Iuno:’ Juno the giver of blessings; “bene sit” being the common form of wishing health, as Cerda remarks: not ‘adsit bona’ as Wagn. thinks. Serv. mentions another reading “adsis.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[735] Comp. 8. 173, “sacra . . . celebrate faventes,” and see on 5. 71. Dido first bespeaks the favour of the gods, then that of her people, begging them to make the gathering auspicious. Comp. generally “celebratur omnium sermone laetitiaque convivium” Cic. 2 Verr. 1. 26. ‘Coetus’ of a festive gathering Catull. 62 (64). 33, 385, 407.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[736] ‘In mensam’—the altar, as it were, of Hospitable Jove. “In mensam laeti libant” 8. 279. This use of a table for libation is questioned by one of the interlocutors in Macrob. Sat. 3. 11, and supported by another, who adduces a passage from Papirius the ritualist lawyer, where a table dedicated to Juno is said to be used as an altar. From this he argues that the table in 8. 279 had doubtless been dedicated along with the “ara maxuma:” in the present case he thinks the libation was less formal, being practised by Dido alone (contrast “omnes” 8. 278), who as a queen had certain immunities. Lersch, who quotes this and other passages § 66, seems to ignore the distinction. In Hom. at any rate there are libations where there is no mention of altars (Il. 16. 230 foll.). ‘Laticum honorem,’ the offering which consists of wine. The ‘mensa’ seems to be the “mensa secunda,” that being the time of the feast when libations took place. We may observe that nothing is said here of the delicacies accompanying the second course, though they appear to be glanced at 8. 283.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[737] Libato, not “honore libato,” but the impersonal participle used absolutely. See Madvig, § 429. With ‘summo tenus attigit ore’ comp. Eur. Iph. A. 950, ἅψεται οὐδ᾽ εἰς ἄκραν χεῖρ᾽. “Labrorum tenus” Lucr. 1.940.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[738] Bitias is a Carthaginian name. Comp. Sil. 2. 409. Serv. refers to Livy for the fact that a Bitias commanded the Carthaginian fleet. The cup seems to be passed to the Carthaginians, because it was chiefly from them that the pledge of hospitality was required. ‘Increpitans,’ bidding him be quick (‘inpiger’). “Aestatem increpitans seram Zephyrosque morantis” G. 4. 138. ‘Hausit’ and ‘se proluit’ are opposed to ‘summo tenus attigit ore.’ There is playful humour in the contrast, which is too lightly touched to be undignified, as some have thought, even if Virg. could not appeal to the example of Hom. in speaking of the Phaeacian court.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[739] Pleno se proluit auro. “Swilled himself with the full gold.” Trapp. See Apoll. R. 1. 470. The commentators comp. Hor. 1 S. 5. 16, “multa prolutus vappa.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[740] The bard is introduced at the feast in imitation of Hom., Od. 1. 325 foll. and 8. 499 foll. Mr. Gladstone must have forgotten this passage, and also 9. 774 foll., when he notices (Homeric Studies, vol. 3, p. 532) as a significant fact that Virg. “has nowhere placed on his canvas the figure of the bard among the abodes of men.”—‘Crinitus.’ Long hair was part of the costume of bards, in imitation of Apollo. See Cerda's note. Serv. on v. 738 says “Iopas unus de procis Didonis, ut Punica testatur historia.” If this is not an error for ‘Iarbas,’ we must suppose that Virg. here as elsewhere has chosen to take a hint from chroniclers to whom it did not suit him to incur a larger debt.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[741] Personat, fills the hall. Comp. Tac. A. 16. 4, “Plebs personabat certis modis plausuque conposito.” ‘Quem’ is the reading of Med., Rom., Pal., and other MSS. adopted by the later editors. Heyne and formerly Wagn. read ‘quae,’ which has the authority of Serv., “quae legendum est, non quem,” and some MSS. Were the change worth making, the MSS. would scarcely stand in the way, as ‘e’ is often written for ‘ae,’ and QVEMAXVMVS might be interpreted either way (see on G. 2. 219). Atlas in Hom. Od. 1. 52 knows the depths of the sea, and supports the pillars of earth and heaven, the epithet given to him being ὀλοόφρων. He seems also to have been a sort of mythical representative or progenitor of physical philosophers, among whom he is recorded by Diogenes Laertius. Being identified with the African mountain, he is naturally chosen by Virg. here as the instructor of a Carthaginian bard. For the conception of Iopas see note on G. 2. 477, and comp. the song of Orpheus Apoll. R. 1. 496 foll., and that of Virg.'s own Silenus, which is imitated from it, E. 6. 31 foll.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[742] Errantem lunam, the revolutions of the moon. G. 1. 337, “Quos ignis caeli Cyllenius erret in orbis.” For ‘solis labores’ see on G. 2. 478. Henry's attempt to make ‘labores’ here mean simply revolutions is refuted by that passage and by Prop. 3. 26. 52, there quoted, and not supported by Sil. 14. 348, “atque una pelagi lunaeque labores,” which is merely a zeugma. ‘Labores,’ as he says, are toils; but an eclipse may be one of the moon's toils, as a storm of the sea's.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[743] Unde hominum genus, &c. This is among the first subjects of the songs of Orpheus and Silenus. ‘Imber’ the element of water. Comp Lucr. 1.714, “Et qui quattuor ex rebus posse omnia rentur, Ex igni terra atque anima procrescere et imbri.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[744] Pluvias is a translation of ‘Hyadas.’ Comp. note on v. 293. Some inferior MSS. give “Pleiadas” or “Pliadas” for ‘pluvias.’ ‘Triones:’ see on G. 3. 381: here the Great and Little Bear are meant. The line is repeated 3. 516, where, as here and G. 1. 138, the enumeration is meant as a poetical equivalent for the stars generally. Comp. Il. 18. 484.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[745] For this and the next line see G. 2. 481, 482 and note.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[747] Ingeminant plausu like “ingeminant hastis,” 9. 811. Some inferior MSS. give ‘plausum,’ with the Schol. on Lucan 1. 133. The natives are naturally made to set the fashion, the strangers to follow it, as Serv. remarks.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[748] “Traherent per talia tempus” 6. 537 note. See also on G. 3. 379, where I have explained “noctem ducere,” “trahere,” of speeding along. But it is very difficult to say, as the more usual sense of “trahere” when applied to time is to protract (see the Lexicons), and the reference here may be to the length to which the conversation continued into the night. Perhaps Virg. intended to blend the two notions, in spite of their apparent inconsistency, meaning no more than that the conversation lasted the whole night long.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[749] She drank in love with the words of Aeneas. ‘Longum’ probably refers to the notion of length contained in ‘trahebat.’ “Longum amorem” 3. 487 note. Serv. says “Alludit ad convivium. Sic Anacreon, ἔρωτα πίνων:” but this can hardly be meant.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[750] “Multa super Lauso rogitat” 10. 839.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[751] Quibus armis. See note on v. 489. “Quibus ibat in armis” 9. 269.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[752] Quales Diomedis equi. No especial praise is given to the horses of Diomede in the Iliad, though high praise is given to those which he takes from Aeneas (Il. 5. 263 foll.), and with which he wins the chariot-race (Il. 23. 377 foll.), as also to those which he takes from Rhesus (Il. 10. 567). Serv. thinks that these are meant to be the descendants of the flesh-eating horses of Diomedes of Thrace, Lucr. 5.29. It is possible that there may be some confusion between the names; it is possible too that Virg. may have remembered the prowess of Diomede's horses in the chariotrace without recollecting that they were once Aeneas' own. Generally too he may have remembered that Diomede was in a chariot when he encountered Aeneas. That he refers to this encounter and also to that of Achilles with Aeneas is almost certain from 10. 581, where Liger says to Aeneas, “Non Diomedis equos, non currum cernis Achilli.”—‘Quantus,’ how terrible in war. Comp. “quantus In clipeum adsurgat” 11. 283, said by Diomede himself of Aeneas. The notion of bulk is prominent, but not, as Henry thinks, the only one.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[753] Immo, nay rather, instead of answering more questions in detail, tell us the whole story from the first.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[754] Tuorum and ‘tuos’ are distinguished, as in the one case Dido is thinking of those who perished at Troy, in the other of Aeneas who escaped. In answering the question 2. 10 Aeneas classes himself with his friends, “casus nostros.”\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"[755] Portat errantem should be taken closely together. “Septuma post Troiae excidium iam vertitur aestas, Cum freta, cum terras omnis . . ferimur” 5. 626. The form of Dido's words shows that she knew the time of the fall of Troy not from Aeneas, but from Teucer (v. 623), or from common fame. The general meaning is, ‘You have the experiences of seven years to tell: it will be better that we should hear them continuously, the story being as long as it is.’ \n";
